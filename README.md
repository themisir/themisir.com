Personal website powered by gohugo.io. The primary content of the website is usually about technology and software engineering. But from time to time I am thinking about writing non tech related stuff as well.

Here's some articles I am especially proud of:

- [Role based Authorization with Identity Server 4](https://themisir.com/adding-role-claim-to-identity-server-4/) - this article was the reason why I decided to continue writing this blog. It got huge attention of search engines and I felt like I was there actually helping people! That was a great feeling.
- [Introduction to Distributed Systems](https://themisir.com/distributed-systems/) - I wrote contents of this article to use as a speech material during a developer networking event that I attempted as a speaker for the first time. That event was special for me because it was the time I decided to "fix" my social anxiety and try exposing myself in order to see it's not really that hard.
- [Implementing Ordered Concurrent Queue](https://themisir.com/implementing-ordered-queue/) - during the writing process of this I felt like a genius, only to realize afterwards that I am just re-implementing a priority queue. Still it was a great experience.
