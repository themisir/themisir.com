Hello, I'm Misir if that's not obvious yet.

I don't know why but we usually introduce ourselves with our career first. So I am making my living off doing software engineering. I used to write code for fun as well, but lately I spend most of my free time learning different kinds of skills. In last 3-4 years I learned playing [piano](https://themisir.com/piano/), got a bit better understanding [photography](https://themisir.com/galleries/), and nowadays I'm busy learning to fly planes.

I also enjoy playing piano, photography, writing and recently got into flying as well.

This blog is currently my primary outlet to the online world. I started writing articles without having any purpose or goal, and continued doing so for years; then I re-evaluated them all and after overthinking lost all my motivation to continue writing. That said I am trying to commit into writing articles to share my stories. I don't know, maybe in a sense it is a way for me to immortalize my inner self despite not being afraid of death.

I have also engaged in business activities, started a startup before COVID-19 was a thing. Despite failing on that, the 3+ years journey had a substantial effect on forming my life and outlook. I used the opportunity to learn both technical and more abstract side of engineering and entrepreneurship. I managed to kickstart the entire tech stack (backend, infra, x-plat mobile app, website), participated in hiring process to build and manage team of developers older than me at the time. Due to my lack of experience, running out of financial resources and market conditions we decided to stop working on the product and moved to different markets. I had a bittersweet feeling left from that experience, I am hoping to get back to doing business again. If you are interested on a collab feel free to reach out.

## Now

Currently I am working as a Software Engineer on the front office team at [bp](https://bp.com/) building and maintaining tools for trading desks.

Trying to study Computer Science Engineering BSc. at Obuda university in Budapest.

Actually & properly studying PPL(A) at a local flight school - [CAVOK Aviation Training Kft](https://cavok.hu).
