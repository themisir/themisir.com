Hello, I'm Misir

I don't know why but we usually introduce ourselves with our career first. So I am making my living off doing software engineering. I used to write code for fun as well, but lately I spend most of my free time learning different kinds of skills. In last 3-4 years I learned playing [piano](https://themisir.com/piano/), got a bit better understanding [photography](https://themisir.com/galleries/), and nowadays I'm busy learning to fly planes.

I have also engaged in business activities, started a startup before COVID-19 was a thing. Despite failing on that, the 3+ years journey had a substantial effect on forming my life and outlook. I used the opportunity to learn both technical and more abstract side of engineering and entrepreneurship. I managed to kickstart the entire tech stack (backend, infra, x-plat mobile app, website), participated in hiring process to build and manage team of developers older than me at the time. Due to my lack of experience, running out of financial resources and market conditions we decided to stop working on the product and moved to different markets. I had a bittersweet feeling left from that experience, I am hoping to get back to doing business again. If you are interested on a collab feel free to reach out.

## How to connect?

The easiest way to reach out would be sending an email to _me at themisir.com_. Feel free to ask, or just say hi. I am less weird in writing than in person, so email is a good way to get things started. If you reach out to promote your product, I am going to report your email to the spam filters.
