We all have opinions, views, certain values and a life, a reality what we call. We gain that feeling of "reality" around us for granted. Without ever thinking about it sometimes. We think stuff around us are in a way just because that's how it's supposed to be. We agree or disagree with opinions of our peers, parents, loved or un-loved ones. Sometimes we question ourselves, the other times we just accept our identity.

Is it truthfully that the reality surrounding us is actually a "real" thing to be aware of? How dare we are so sure about things, without having a strong base to hold onto. How we are sure that `2 + 2` is equals to four. What if I told you that `2 + 2` is not four. You'd call me crazy probably. Most people in a "right" mindset would probably do the same as well.

However, what we are missing is the fact that we got all these assumptions for granted without questioning its reality. Because, it just worked. It helped us to solve problems in our small world. We were too ignorant to actually wander around and see things from different angles, question them, or even consider what if `2 + 2` is actually five, not four. Would anything had been different if that's the case? Probably not, the life would be as usual as it has been. Nobody would even notice that `2 + 2` is five as like us not questioning the current "reality".

If this sounds like a ricidious example then think about zero and all the other negative numbers. Heck, think about the times where we didn't had any numbers to think of. If it is a "reality", then why we hadn't had numbers until it become a necessity back then. There was times when people lived without having to worry about division by zero problem, back then when there was no zero or any other number to think of.

Yet nowadays, we accept them as a something that's crucial part of the life, that life can not be exist without, that we are trying to model our entire "reality" with them. **We are modelling our "REALITY" with something that wasn't even a thing a few thousands years ago.** We are so confident with our "reality" that we forgot to even think about it. We are spoiled kids of the "reality", "reality" that we are not even sure of its existence, yet we assume it is.

If we can't be even sure about the very simple building block of our current science and "reality" around us, how dare we are sure about everything else that's composed of that unsure "reality". Does it even matter if `2 + 2` is four or five? It's all just our perception, our perception of the "reality" we built our life and science upon.

I do humbly believe that if we can't even be sure of `2 + 2` is four, but we just assume it as is; even thought it can be "five" as much as it can be "four" at the same time we can't be sure of any other "realities" as well. We simply can't. All we got to do is just assume and believe in the realities we create in our minds. If you don't shake those thought, don't question them then life is all good, everything is real and you are right about all your opinions. 

However, we got all these weird ideas some of which even is considered as a global constraints, all because of people questioning things around themselves. Questioning their "realities" and their perceptions. Without looking from a different angle we wouldn't probably had progressed as a civilization. A civilization where we are spending more resources for eliminating each other than giving them an hand. Maybe, just maybe if in our reality `2 + 2` was five instead, we would have evolved to be completely different species.

I got my inspiration to write this essay after watching and thinking about [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaq4aYPzCc). As an analytic someone, for the most part of my life, I assumed that math and science around us is just a part of the reality. However, now I understood that, it's just about our perception. If we believe in it then that's our reality. If enough people believes, then that's the reality, a universal one. That's how we have no issue perceiving the number zero. Some people have no issue perceiving that a number that when multiplied by itself resulting in "-1" exist (irrational numbers we call them). As I said before, if enough people believe, then you are no longer a crazy.

If not, then you may end up being burned to the death for assuming that Earth is circling around the Sun. As a matter of fact none of those matters. Both the Sun and the Earth is moving around each other, both statements are "right" and "wrong" in a similar degree (if you put Earth on the center of the coordinate system, Sun and all the other planets would be moving around the earth, not in a circular motion, but we would be static in the middle). It's just matter of how many people you can influence to your belief. Or does it even matter?
