thewe’s something about humans t-that makes them u-unique. :3 yet we usuawwy t-twy to get w-wid of them fow s-some weason. 😳😳😳 minow i-impewfections, s-smow fwaws we’ve a-aww got. the humbwe touch gives a humane feew to the stuff we made and make. -.- i-it’s aww the smow mistakes that made “mona w-wisa” so speciaw. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) you can’t g-get the same feewing when you wook at pewfectwy dwawn computew-genewated i-imagewy. rawr x3 they awe usuawwy m-missing a s-smow human touch, nyaa~~ minow mistakes we aww make that make amazing end wesuwts.

why on eawth do we aww awe twying t-to be pewfect if o-ouw impewfection i-is nyani makes u-us - humans so s-speciaw? maybe w-we don’t wike h-how we have been b-buiwt. (U ﹏ U) ow maybe we do know that we can’t weach a pewfect “pewfection” point, >_< b-but making ouw mistakes a wot smowew might be t-the point we’we twying to weach. rawr x3 t-the things we make wouwd be a wot mowe pewfect in a way, mya whiwe s-stiww having the humane feewing w-we thought a p-pewfect awt might be wacking. nyaa~~ maybe, (⑅˘꒳˘) the wess subtwe the impewfection is the mowe i-impwessive it becomes. rawr x3 who knows? (sewiouswy, (✿oωo) if you know any weseawch ow book wewated to this b-behaviow, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ i wouwd wuv to wead i-it to weawn mowe a-about the subject).

anyway, σωσ nyext time when you see youw i-impewfection, σωσ j-just wemembew t-that’s just a s-sign that you - a-a human being made i-it. >_< it’s kind o-of wike youw s-signatuwe. :3 you don’t have to be ashamed of mistakes ow impewfections you’ve m-made :)
