I am a fool. Possibly you are a fool too, but you may want to argue otherwise, up to you. I am a fool to fight against the ends. The ends that's unavoidable for us - mortals. It's not just about 'death', as a matter of fact I fully embraced it and content with the fact that my life will come to an end one day.

However, death is the only 'end' we can sometimes think of, or it's the biggest and the most dramatic one that leaves other 'ends' on its shadow. When in fact there's many ends in life. We assume they are non possible outcomes until they happen. An end to some dream you've had, an end of your career, an end of certain goals you've had, an end of certain life moments. We sometimes forget that those exist. We keep ourselves distracted from the reality of those and many more ends. When it presumably happens disappointment surrounds us, like we weren't already in the contract of life where those ends may have happened regardless. Embracing those ends may bring a light in life to brighten pathways we previously ignored.

Maybe ends are necessary to give us a meaning in life. Perhaps we endure the limiting nature and let it clear our way around the journey which some may call "life".

I am not sure where I am going with this one, it's just a short dump out of my mind I wanted to put out here. Perhaps it's time for another end. An end necessary for new creations to happen. Not all ends meant to be imbearable.
