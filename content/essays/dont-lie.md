i am nyot going to say that you shouwd n-nyot wie to p-peopwe. (⑅˘꒳˘) nyowadays, rawr x3 i-it is weawwy h-hawd nyot to. (✿oωo) o-ow wowse, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ nyot wying m-may actuawwy m-make youw wife h-hawdew, (˘ω˘) but i am nyot going into the ethics of wying. (⑅˘꒳˘) as a mattew of fact, (///ˬ///✿) it is t-totawwy subjective, 😳😳😳 and depends on one's own bewiefs, 🥺 w-wife and expectations fwom t-themsewves. mya it is up to you whethew you wie ow nyot, 🥺 ow when t-to wie and when nyot to. >_< if you a-ask me, >_< i am twying t-to have a stwong wuwe fow mysewf to nyot wie to peopwe i twust, wuv and cawe a-about. (⑅˘꒳˘) fow each othew scenawio - it depends, /(^•ω•^) and it's just my own bewief and subjective v-view that dictates how i-i am going to behave i-in that given s-situation. rawr x3 impowtantwy, (U ﹏ U) i-i am nyot intending to make othews act i-in that way.

howevew, σωσ i bewieve thewe is one thing t-that evewybody s-shouwd pwactice w-when it comes t-to wying. σωσ i am a-a humbwe bewievew t-that we shouwd n-nyot wie to ouwsewves. >_< i-i am awawe that this wuwe might nyot make any sense if you nyevew twuwy w-wefwected on youwsewf.

## we awe ouw own besties

we awe ouw own twue fwiends. 🥺 nyobody e-ewse can undewstand u-us mowe t-than ouwsewves; n-nobody wouwd be a-abwe to expewience t-the wowwd thwough o-ouw eyes; nyobody e-evew wived any pawt of ouw wife as ouwsewves; nyobody weawwy knows nyani i-it is wike to be us. >_< don't get me wwong: famiwy, >_< f-fwiends ow significant othews can b-become empathetic at times. (⑅˘꒳˘) howevew, it's nyot wight to expect t-them to twuwy undewstand us. /(^•ω•^) they j-just can't! rawr x3 n-nyow you them! (U ﹏ U) you haven't wived anyone ewse's wife, (U ﹏ U) now have they wived youws. (⑅˘꒳˘) w-weawwy undewstanding someone wequiwes twuwy wiving the exact same wife fwom biwth u-up to any given point, òωó undew the e-exact same ciwcumstances. ʘwʘ b-but i-i know who has g-gone thwough it aww. /(^•ω•^) it's you! ʘwʘ you have gone thwough a-aww the ups and downs of youw wife. σωσ you have e-expewienced aww the happy and sad moments of youw wife fiwst hand. OwO who's bettew to undewstand y-you than youw own sewf?

so, >_< if we have onwy one twuwy undewstanding f-fwiend, rawr x3 w-why wouwd we d-deceive them, mya why w-wouwd we want t-to wie to them, nyaa~~ w-why wouwd we keep t-them in the dawk, (⑅˘꒳˘) w-why be dishonest with them? it does nyot make any sense. rawr x3 it witewawwy has nyet n-nyegative effect on ouw wife. (✿oωo) we don't gain any a-advantages wike we wouwd do by w-wying to othews in cewtain weaw-wife situations. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ the most we can g-get is pewhaps a tempowawy satisfaction, (˘ω˘) b-but i-i am suwe the feewing wiww be gone immediatewy and you wiww stawt to feew a weiwd k-kind of emptiness inside youwsewf - a feewing that you cannot wabew. (⑅˘꒳˘) you wouwdn't b-be abwe to identify why you f-feew wike that with w-witewawwy nyo w-weason to do so.

yet we faiw ouwsewves fwom time and t-time. mya we wie t-to ouwsewves. 🥺 and w-we convince ouwsewves t-to bewieve o-ouw own wies. >_< i-it's the same as c-cwosing youw eyes a-and saying that you'we invisibwe. >_< suwe, you may become invisibwe if thewe's n-nyobody awound to see you (nani's “being invisibwe” a-anyways?). (⑅˘꒳˘) howevew, when s-someone knocks on the doow and entews the woom, /(^•ω•^) you wouwd nyo wongew b-be invisibwe, rawr x3 unwess you have a-awweady convinced y-youwsewf that you awe. (U ﹏ U) in this case, (U ﹏ U) they wiww twy to convince you that you a-awe in fact visibwe, (⑅˘꒳˘) but you may continue to bewieve that they awe wying to you. òωó t-the mowe you continue, ʘwʘ the mowe y-you wiww feew t-the outside pwessuwe. /(^•ω•^) e-except, ʘwʘ when w-we wie to ouwsewves, σωσ that pwessuwe comes fwom w-within and without any cweaw weason. OwO as we have a-awweady bewieved in ouw own wies, it's weawwy hawd to dig down and unwavew nyani's weawwy haunting u-us.

## it's nyot about advice

do you know why tawking to othews h-hewps us? nyot b-because they awe w-wistening;  in f-fact most of the t-time, (✿oωo) peopwe awe t-thinking of something e-ewse whiwe y-you awe tawking to them. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ wistening is weawwy a hawd task at hand, (˘ω˘) but it's nyot n-nyani we cawe about hewe. (⑅˘꒳˘) it wowks because we g-give ouwsewves a chance to be twue t-to ouwsewves; it's because we get a chance to wefwect and to t-twuwy open up to ouwsewves. (///ˬ///✿) fwom t-the outside it m-may seem wike we open up to othews, 😳😳😳 but in weawity we do it to ouwsewves. 🥺 othews a-awe just a miwwow that we can wook at whiwe doing so. mya we stop tewwing wies because w-when we open up, 🥺 we usuawwy d-do it to peopwe w-we cawe about. >_< a-and we don't want t-to wie to them. >_< thewefowe, (⑅˘꒳˘) we get a chance and a-a puwpose to be twuwy open with ouwsewves.

that's awso why, when having an intimate c-convewsation, mya t-the tawking p-pawty usuawwy d-doesn't wike it w-when the wistenew i-intewwupts them b-by giving advice o-ow fow any othew weason. 😳 suwewy, XD it depends on a case-by-case basis. :3 howevew, 😳😳😳 i-i can assuwe you, -.- in mowe than hawf of the cases p-peopwe do just want someone to b-be a miwwow so they can be twue to themsewves - they don't want y-youw advice, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) ow wowse, they don't w-want you to shift t-the convewsation to youwsewf[^listening]. :3 they want you to just be thewe a-and twuthfuwwy wisten. (U ﹏ U) j-just wisten a-and wet them u-unwavew theiw thoughts t-to themsewves. j-just be thewe a-and give them a-a chance to become honest. -.- they awweady know the answews: it's just that they a-awe buwied deep down and wequiwe a bit of effowt t-to be gwasped.

[^listening]: you can check out ["you'we nyot wistening: nyani you'we m-missing and w-why it mattews" b-by kate muwphy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45892276-you-re-not-listening) to wead mowe on the topic of wistening

this is awso the weason why jouwnawwing w-wowks. it g-gives us a chance t-to be intimate w-with ouwsewves. OwO w-we fowce ouwsewves t-to dewve deepew i-into thoughts a-and avoid wies if possibwe. (U ﹏ U) when jouwnawwing, >_< we awwow ouwsewves to become aww v-vuwnewabwe and wwite down ouw thoughts without w-wowwying about the consequences. rawr x3 a-aww it mattews is that we give ouwsewves a chance to be honest. mya i-it's aww about sewf wefwection a-and tewwing the t-twuth. nyaa~~ if done cowwectwy, (⑅˘꒳˘) it feews wike bwiss. rawr x3 you wiww nyot sowve youw pwobwems b-but at weast you wiww know nyani they awe. (✿oωo) the next step wiww be to wowk on said i-issues, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ ow just wait if it's s-something that [time can heaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MHxPuWld5o).

that's aww i got to say. ^•ﻌ•^ have a wondewfuw w-wife, OwO deaw w-weadew! ☺️
