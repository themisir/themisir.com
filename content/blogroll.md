## [Kev Quirk](https://kevquirk.com)

Kev's blog motivates me to keep writing and maintain this space. He regularly posts new content and updates his website. He also writes a number of meta articles about blogging, which are useful for fellow bloggers.

## [Alvan Rahimli](https://rahim.li)

I appreciate Alvan's writing for its honesty and uncensored views. He covers topics ranging from politics to everyday life. He is also a dear friend who helps me navigate life's struggles and share joyful moments.

## [Bob Nystrom](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com)

I became more interested in technical writing after reading Bob's articles. His explanations clarify complex computer science concepts. He is also the author of one of my favorite programming books â€” [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com).

Recommended read:

- [What Color is Your Function?](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/)

## [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs)

If you're interested in personal development, philosophy, or unique life experiences, Derek's blog is worth reading. His writing motivates me to live intentionally and create. He is also an author, though I haven't read any of his books to offer a proper review.

## ["The Old New Thing"](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/) by Raymond Chen

I'm not a fan of Windows, but I started programming by tinkering with Win32 APIs for fun. If you're like me, you'll enjoy reading about obscure edge cases in the Windows kernel or CPU intricacies.
