I have this thing going on with me lately, for last 2-3 years to be exact. I kind of wandered off thinking about a "purpose" in life, and somehow decided that if I feel lost I will start learning something, anything as long as I am capable.

At first it started with learning piano. At that time I wasn't just trying to "learn something new". At the time my goal was mainly about making the "younger version of me happier" by realizing his wishes. I loved classic music and always wanted / imagined playing piano. So when I got enough financial freedom and some free time, I just went into it and eventually I really enjoyed it. I already have a separate post on [piano training](https://themisir.com/piano/) so I am not going to go deep into that.

However that experience taught me so many stuff about myself. I got more confident, I started to understand myself way better, I learned to force myself into uncomfortable situations without any risk or reward at stake, I learned to express my feelings with music (though mostly when i'm alone in a dark room with a piano). I didn't hate myself for being me, I really started to enjoy living the life as who I am, I was really proud of myself.

## Fast forward to this year

I moved to Budapest in 2024, September. Primarily to restart my BSc studies, give it another go. And yeah the university experience still sucks, I hate waking up at 6am just to sit through 4 to 7 hours of presentation or someone talking while people are playing on their phone and commuting back to home. I thought the pressure might be useful for me to learn rough edges of Computer Science I am lacking at - discrete math, calculus, and stuff that I don't even know exists. Well, I gave them a chance, I hated every moment of it. I know the problem is mostly lies on me. I didn't studied properly, I learned just enough to go through exams and then forgot everything. I felt like I am going to waste my years in Hungary for no particular life improvement.

For some reason around the last quarter of 2024 I got interested in aeroplane accident reports and watching analysis videos on YouTube. I didn't had any particular interest in flying previously. I just started overconsuming the same kind of content, watched all past and current videos of some popular channels and somehow learned just enough to have rough idea about what's going inside planes (very rough and overconfident estimate).

Still it was just an entertaining content consumption for me. I wasn't particularly engaged in any way. Over time my curiosity wandered around the concept and I got into playing Microsoft Flight Simulator (MSFS) 2020. MSFS 2024 was already released at the time but the reviews was pointing out major bugs and stability issues, so I just ended up with one generation old version. I started playing around the planes, pressing random buttons to figure out how they work. From the videos I had rough idea about the aviation lingo and flight control interfaces. Still though jumping right into an Airbus A320 was not particularly a good idea. I couldn't even start the engine. The game had an incredible training section which taught basic controls, airspace procedures, and navigation briefs. I spent around 4-5 hours on the training section and got somewhat used to flying Cessna 172N on the sim(ulator). By flying I mean taking off then crash landing on a good day. I don't know why but even without any particular knowledge or goal in the game, it was just fun. I spent a quite significant amount in the game for someone without any past interest in flying.

## What if ...?

We have a lovely chatroom with close friends where we talk almost daily. I started sharing a lot of stuff from the games and plane facts. Then we started jokingly chatting about piloting actual planes. After some time I started to take it more seriously and started asking, "what if I really invested into becoming a pilot?". I really love and hate "what if?" questions. I hate them because they linger off on my brain until I get a definitive answer. I love them because they are usually concrete questions that I can actually try to find an answer, and they usually push me to try out new stuff just for the sake of getting an answer.

I wasn't particularly serious, but I started researching about pilot training process. I think I just looked at a few reddit posts and ads on the flight school websites. I didn't put much time into it. I had a rough idea about the process but that's it. I wasn't going to study anyways. I was just entertaining the idea on my head though since my studies are not going well, I felt like I can still turn the Budapest experience to more fulfilling one.

On January 2025, I visited my friends and family in Baku. I was still joking around it with friends. I was getting annoyed that I didn't have access to my PC to play some flightsim when I was in Baku. After returning on a reddit post I saw someone mention something along the lines of "Here's how you can fly a plane without having a license", and the answer was "If you attend a demo flight at a flight school, they might let you fly the plane as well". For some reason I just found a random flight school not so far away from me, emailed them about the possibility of a demo flight. Got an answer back in a day, and somehow I ended up scheduling a flight.

## Demo flight

My flight was scheduled for 11 February, 2025. I booked a taxi to the airport. I had never been to a small airfield before, so I wasn't really sure what to expect. The ride went smooth, we found the place easily, I walked down the field while reading tables in front of hangars, found the school's hangar, approached them and the rest went smoothly as well. The instructor pilot introduced himself, started preparing the aeroplane. It was an Aero AT-3 model two seater, low wing plane. It was a cold morning, so the instructor was heating up the engine before startup. Apparently it is necessary to keep the engine running smoothly to reduce wear&tear.

Afterwards we boarded the plane, the instructor filled up aircraft techlog and briefed the flight. We were going to fly to the training zone and do some basic maneuvres, then return back to the airfield to do traffic circuits. Okay lots of terms here, sorry about that.

Then he started the engine and boy my brain started freezing until the touchdown at the end of the flight. I was there, but I felt like I am skipping the frames. Time went very quickly that I only remembered brief moments after the flight. Takeoff was stressful for me, we took off from a grass runway which wasn't smooth. So I felt all the bumps while accelerating to 50 knots (~93 km/h). When we reached the target speed, oh boy that moment I still remember what it felt like. It wasn't anything like takeoffs on the commercial planes. It's very hard to explain it with words, I felt acceleration in both forward and upwards directions, it pushed me more to the seat. And the plane felt all the "bumps" in the air. So it was not feeling stable at all. I was happy that it happened very quickly since I didn't even had time to realize I was scared at the moment.

I tried to look cool both to the pilot and to myself as well. We continued climbing to around 1000 feet above the ground (~300 meters). The instructor then demonstrated basic maneuvres. I was still feeling a bit scared but was also enjoying the moment. He then let me do some maneuvres on my own. He instructed me to climb to certain altitude, turn to certain heading, etc. After around 30 minutes of maneuvreing in the training box he asked if I'm okay with proceeding with stall recovery demonstration. From the previous sim experience I had a rough idea what's going to happen, but I wasn't expecting it to happen that fast and obviously I wasn't expecting to feel negative G forces (you feel like the ground falling off from you) since the sim wasn't providing any feedback to my body. Not gonna lie that was the most adrenaline pumping moment of that flight that I remember to this day. We then returned back to the airfield, configured for approach (meaning changed airplane configuration to fly at lower speeds for smoother landing). I was kind of hoping that it's going to end now. Not because I hated the experience, but I thought that's enough adrenaline for today. Instead we did a touch-and-go instead, meaning after touching the ground we accelerated and climbed again. After another circling around the airfield we landed and fully stopped.

I was planning to return and continue working that day, but my brain was exhausted that day. I didn't have the energy to continue so after coming back to home I just took that day off.

I sincerely thank Mil√°n H. for the flight. It's because of you that after a week I spontaneously decided to register for flight classes. Yeah I might sound like it was all just a scary adrenaline pumped experience, but not really. It's my lack of enlgish dictionary knowledge that I can't express my feelings properly.

## So we're doing this now?

Yeap. I emailed back the school's salesperson and asked to proceed with the registration for Private Pilot License (PPL) training. Before moving on if you're interested how the licensing process works in Europe (EASA) region, check my [PPL guide](/ppl).

I paid the initial installment then completed the registration admin work around early March and got access to the ground school materials. At first I wasn't properly studying but after around 20 days I decided to aim for finishing everything by April so ideally I could finish my training by September. It was a kind of a boring process, lots of stuff to memorize and [the LMS platform](https://www.evionica.com) was hell of a pain to use. Today I wish instead of it, I learned from proper resources, have I done that I would have saved so much time because I ended up re-learning them again to prepare for exam.

I finished my ground school material and proceeded to the actual practical flight training around the second week of april. That's going to be my first proper training flight. For training I have been assigned to Tecnam P2002 JF model aeroplane and another awesome instructor Danila B. Before the flight on the first day we did a long briefing, going over the training process, required pre-flight documentation, aeroplane basics, how to prepare aeroplane for flight, walkarounds, basic operational procedures and so on. Then we went into the plane. I sit on the commander's seat this time (left seat), started the engine and did some taxi training on ground. Then we went to take off and start basic flight maneuvre training. It was kind of similar to the one I had during the demo flight, but we were more strict and more cautious, trying to be more on spot (ie. trying to match the target speed, altitude, heading more percisely). This time the flight went more smoothly in terms of the anxiety and such. I was more relaxed and got used to the plane over the course of the flight. The turbulence was not bothering me as much.

Anyways the flight went on, I started attending the practical trainings semi-regularly. The weather was not on my side, so I had to cancel lots of scheduled flights. Almost half of the scheduled flights have been cancelled until today.

Nowadays, I am learning emergency procedures to recover from any possible engine failure on the ground or during any flight phase. After finishing 5 hours of emergency procedures training I will be able to start flying solo. But before solo flights my current school requires me to pass CAA theory exam (all 9 subjects). So nowadays I have been going through test banks to refresh my knowledge before the exam.

## Then what?

I started and invested a significant amount of time and money into this endeveour. It all started from small harmless jokes, then "what ifs?" and now I spend my free time online browsing used airplane sale websites, imagining owning one of them one day.

Owning a plane is not my motivation for the training. I enjoyed to process as a whole. The community both online and offline in the school is amazing. My instructors are really amazing people to hang around with.

It filled the emptiness I had from my disappointing BSc. classes. It feels more professional, both instructors and people coming in to learn are committed, are not there just to spend time.

Flying is freedom, I feel in control of my own destiny.

I enjoy complex systems, I enjoy trying to be on top of all the variables to have a general view. Planes are complex machines, you have to control them in 3 axes at once, while maintaining the correct power settings and using flaps & trim to your advantage. All that while monitoring that engine is working properly and you have enough fuel for your trip. Oh and you're not flying alone, both inside (optional) and outside the plane. You need to keep track of planes around you, both visually and consciously. Keep your eye and ear open for new inputs. You also need to be one step ahead and be in control of everyone around you as well, make sure they are aware of you. Those are all the variables you need to be on top of, analyze and make sound decisions. So much so you need to be 1 step forward and predict what might be going to happen and be ready for it!

There's more _fun_ stuff as well if you want! Like being aware of the laws which changes from place to place, and knowing your own limitations like the fact that brain doesn't always have a goor perception of position, oh and the weather of course!

All in all it's a complex system that I'm willing to get better at simulating on my head. That's why I love software engineering, that's why I love music making, and now flying.
