**This blog post is written by a stranger who has little to no expereince on physiology. If you're experiencing severe anxiety, I would suggest getting help from a professional rather than continuing to read this blog post.**

As an introvert I usually got labeled by people as a unsocial or asocial personl from time to time. Well to be honest that might be a correct label for my teenage years. I was really asocial during that time, I was scared of talking to people out of my circle, I usually let others to start conversations, I didn't said any word in situation where my mind was blown away with things I wanted to say but couldn't. Why tho? After realizing that being "asocial" isn't going to be a good thing for future me, I did some research on being asocial, and being introverted person. During those years I learned that lots of my social awkardness is coming from my insecurities, I was scared af to say something wrong. I usually got through things multiple times before saying them, but by that time the subject was usually changed so there was no reason to talk anyways.

Actually I don't hate that "thinking before saying" behavior of myself (and lots of others has this behavior as well). The thing is you don't have to say much to get things rolling anyways, and in some situations being silent is more suitable choice. However things become unhealthy when you get obsessed with it. I got obsessed with overthinking about stuff I wanted to say. Overthinking sucks, a lot.. It makes you stressed over every minor detail that shouldn't matter to most people. So after all those realization I decided to work on it, and improve my "human" skills.

## What I did?

Not much to be honest, the most important point of this was actually realization. I realized and accepted that most of the stuff I'm going to say will not going to hurt anybody, will not going to make me "a bad person", or will not embrass me. But I couldn't just sit there and wait for some magic to make stuff happen. I tried moving things step by step by doing something called "exposure therapy". As the name tells it's a therapy that you heal your worries by exposing yourself to situations you have fear of. Well, "being social" was the situation in my case.

Actually I was lucky that by that time with a friend we were building a company, and I was got titled CTO there. What that meant is that I was going to talk a lot of people, and I had no other choice if I didn't wanted to talk. I got chance to reach out to people, have a conversation with them that I wouldn't expected to have a few years ago. So things turned out in a way that led me to do an "exposure therapy" without my explicit intention. Well that was my story, it was a bit weird and probably it's not a good idea to build a company and reach out to fundraisers just to fix your insecurities. However you can put yourself in a situation where you **have** to talk to people.

All good and stuff, but did it helped? Was that enough? Not really. I accepted that I was lacking self confidence. God forbid if I were to talk to foreigners, I would get scared and stressed A LOT before that call or whatever it is going to happen. I was scared to pronounce something wrong, or someone might not understand me, or they laugh at me. Well the thing is, nobody is perfect in this world. They just pretend to be perfect and people like us believe in it, because they advertise traits we're lacking of. Another moment of realization for me was this: *everyone has flaws, they know it, others know it as well, but nobody cares in most cases* (why would them anyways, if you pronounced something wrong but the other people understand what you wanted to say anyways, you got it, nothing else matters after that point). Realizing that helped me to relieve my stress, I just try to accept the fact that the other person does have his/her own insecurities as well as ours, so no need to idealize them and try being the perfect representation.

So by the time I put myself in lots of situations to socialize with other people. Somehow I become less anxious about talking to people, It was way easier for me to meet new people, start conversation or socialize in general. Well I wouldn't say the anxiety was totally gone, nope, it's still there to this day, but it's not in a level that's hard to manage. So instead of days of anxiety you just get a few minutes of it and you can get over it by accepting that "it's not the end of the world". However I still haven't found a way to get over my anxiety when it comes to talking people in foreign languages. I was aware that it's the same situation, I just need to put myself out there for some time to get used to it. Eventually I did some interviews in English and to be honest even myself was surprised that it wasn't that hard as I expected, I was just overthinking about it A LOT. 

## But I'm still an Introvert

The one thing to remember that being an introvert isn't same thing as being asocial - socially anxious. By fixing your anxiety you're not going to enjoy spending time amongst the people. If you're introvert, you will still prefer cozy places, being alone or being with people who are close to you. Introvertion is a personality trait, it's nor good or bad thing. It's just a way of behaving in different situations. Meanwhile social anxiety is a mental health issue that's going to be struggle over your way to successful career, relationships, life or even on minor cases too.

> **My few cents on being *successful*:** I came into realization that there's no point of "successfullness" you're going to experience. Life is a journey, what are you going to do after reaching success you're craving for? Will you ever be able to reach it? It's hard to agree but there always will be people who are better than us in certain cases. Just accept that and enjoy the journey you're going to experience on the life. Everything else is just labels we put on things to give them some meaning.

If you don't know much about being introvert, I would recommend checking out [this TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0KYU2j0TM4) from Susan Cain, and her book "Quiet". In general as an introvert I still prefer to avoid situations that's going to socially overwhelm me, but unlike old days I'm not afraid to attending them whenever I want to, or people ask me to do. I still don't like to talk that much around people outside my social circle. But I'm not that afraid of stepping outside of that circle either. So simply put things introversion lets you prefer being quiet meanwhile social anxiety takes control of it and doesn't let you step out. 

## Is it Worth it?

Totally. Not just it'll open you more doors, it'll also let you build up self confidence. Self confidence is very important in many cases, from going to a job interview to meeting new people. I don't feel as awkward as I used to be. It helped me to reach futher on my career. I can meet with new people more easily without hours of overthinking.

Well this was quite unusual post on my blog, but it's what it is. I wanted to write a bit about my own personal life experiences rather than just focusing on technology. If you want to provide feedback about this blog post please reach out to me on me@themisir.com.
