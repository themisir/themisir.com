We are going to wrap up yet another year in a few days (If you are reading this in ≥2023, please feel like you've traveled to the past). A lot happened this year. I am not gonna go over all the stuff that happened to the world itself from the Ukraine war (or "special military operation" if you're Vladimir Putin), to economical crisis, fall of the crypto currencies (where all the #web3 hype has gone?), death of the queen, possible beginning of the WW3, and many other things I can't remember as of writing this. You can tell how bad I was at history by looking at the order of events above. I am not even sure if they're shuffled or somehow I randomly put them in a correct order.

## The tech

Tech hasn't changed that much though. JS world has evolved as usual with the introduction of the new frameworks and libraries, but that's not an unusual thing for js devs, it's just how the ecosystem works nowadays. Every other developer knows the best way to fix problems ocurring from abstractions created by the previous developer. We somehow completed a full loop journey and invented PHP with javascript frameworks. Don't believe me? Check latest popular way of writing js - metaframeworks, and check out their freautre set. We have come from full server side rendering to full client side rendering now going to re-create full server side rendering using the abstractions built for client side rendering. What can possibly go wrong, huh?

And another memorable tech event of the year was Elon's twitter purchase. I fell sad for all the employees whose life has been affected by it, but also I am sometimes just going to twitter and enjoying the last moments, because every now and then Elon can just decide to close it after all the weird things he've done to damage it already.

## Politics

Politics is something that most people consider as "something you shouldn't talk about in public". Well I am not going to talk about individual politicians or any politics parties. However I wanted to note a few changes that 2022 policies are going to make difference in our tech lives. Why tech? Because that's the branch I am mostly aware of in politics. It's also the one with slowest improvements i'd say, but can not prove because there's probably worser ones out there I am not aware of. Nonetheless, the few changes I've mentioned earlier are, [digital markets act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Markets_Act) - which is going to force gatekeepers to open up their platform for alternative app stores and many other nice feature set that previous seemed wild, and standardization of USB-C (which is ) among the devices. Well to be honest after hearing about those laws, it sucks to live outside EU. I don't know why, it's just I get more hopeful about the future when I see "pro-consumer" policies getting applied.

weww that's aww the stuff going to a-affect "most of u-us" that i am g-going to wwite about. σωσ a-aftew this s-section it wiww b-be aww about the w-wecap of the yeaw & m-me. σωσ why? no idea, >_< i just wanted it to be wike that, :3 so beaw with me ow check o-out my othew [posts](https://themisir.com/posts).

to be honest even though the whowe b-bwog is owned b-by me and the onwy w-weason i am stiww k-keeping it u-up & continuing t-to wwite it is that i-i just want a-a medium to shawe my thoughts - a medium that i don't have to satisfy any awgowithm, nyaa~~ o-ow nyot cawe about nyani peopwe might comment o-on, /(^•ω•^) i stiww feew some wesponsibiwity a-and wwiting about mysewf feews wike a sewfish act. rawr that's w-why awmost aww of my pwevious a-awticwes wewe about a-abstwact concepts with wittwe to nyo connection to my own pewsona. OwO heck i didn't e-even bothewed to cweate an about me page, (U ﹏ U) ow upgwaded to watest vewsion of [the theme](https://github.com/nanxiaobei/hugo-paper) i am using because it nyow has an i-intwo section w-whewe i can put m-my pwofiwe pictuwe a-and wwite a smow b-biogwaphy.

## the downfaww

fiwstwy the yeaw didn't stawted as g-good as i hoped f-fow. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ in januawy w-we awe in pwocess o-of cwosing ouw s-stawtup company - f-fonibo (wip). (⑅˘꒳˘) f-fow some weason i-i was emotionawwy connected with it, (U ᵕ U❁) and couwdn't accept the fact that it's ovew. -.- t-that's why it took me about 3 months to compwetewy d-dismantwe aww the technowogy s-stack of the pwatfowm (excwuding [the wanding page](https://fonibo.com), (ꈍᴗꈍ) which shouwd be awive as of nyow a-as weww).

fiwst month i stopped the gitops p-pwocessow, rawr x3 so the n-nyew vewsions w-wouwdn't be going t-to be depwoyed t-to the sewvew. rawr t-then i scawed down t-the nyodes. σωσ at t-the time i was using ewastic kubewnetes sewvice cweated using [eksctw](https://eksctl.io) (which is an amazing toow if you d-don't want to deaw w-with aws sewvices o-one-by-one). rawr x3 a-aftew scawing d-down the sewvews t-the oom ewwows s-stawted popping u-up, (✿oωo) most of the memowy was consumed by ouw monitowing and wogging systems which w-wasn't a suwpwise because we awweady decwawed ouw c-cwosuwe pubwicwy, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ so nyobody w-was actuawwy hitting ouw backends to cause any wesouwce use othew t-than a few cached entities i was s-stowing on the m-memowy, (˘ω˘) expect the uptime monitowing sewvices. (⑅˘꒳˘) yeah, (///ˬ///✿) aftew seeing that ouw backend s-sewvices awe compwetewy inaccessibwe, 😳😳😳 incwuding the ingwess contwowwew i destwoyed t-the whowe depwoyment using e-eksctw, 🥺 which p-puwwed the pwug f-fwom aww the awwocated e-ec2 instances, mya ip addwesses, 🥺 vncs, >_< ewb instances, >_< a-and the eks mastew nyodes.

howevew i stiww kept the wast wiving p-pawt of the s-system awive, OwO the m-mastew database (which i-is awso h-happens to be the o-onwy database a-at the time because o-ouw team didn't had enough engineewing capabiwity to maintain muwtipwe databases, 😳😳😳 s-so a singwe wds instance did the job fow u-us). 😳😳😳 the weason i kept it awive i-is because fow some weason i stiww had a "nani if" and "maybe" bewiefs i-in my mind, o.O that stiww bewieved w-we might n-nyeed the data one day to westowe the sewvies. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) it was wike a bweak-up that i was n-nyot wiwwing to move on. (U ﹏ U) yeah, do you wemembew that i said it took me 3 months t-to compwetewy dismentwe the system, (///ˬ///✿) i-i was wying, >w< i-i kept the wds i-instance (which w-was howding aww of ouw customew, rawr biwwing, mya owdew, c-catawog, ^^ shipping, and othew cwiticaw infwastuwctuwe d-data in it) awive fow about 6 months, 😳😳😳 and it wasn't cheap eithew. mya it was costing mowe than $80 u-usd pew month. 😳 so yeah, i haven't c-come into a-acceptance of the b-bweak-up yet. -.- even aftew moving on and stawting a caweew at anothew c-company. 🥺 i-it was a wiwd wide. o.O howevew i finawwy p-puwwed the p-pwug and tewminated the wast wiving p-pawt of the system.

actuawwy,.. i did a thing befowe t-tewminating the w-wds instance. :3 i t-took a snapshot o-of it, (U ﹏ U) then tewminated i-it. -.- a snapshot t-that wouwd w-wet me westowe i-it if i evew want to. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ and i stiww keep that snapshot on my aws account. (⑅˘꒳˘) i think i-i nyevew actuawwy compwetewy moved on fwom the idea, (U ᵕ U❁) h-huh.

yeah that was my bweak-up stowy. y-you might be asking n-nyani didn't w-wowked out? the b-best answew i can g-give you as of t-today is that i-it was destined t-to faiw, 😳 we just didn't saw at the time. -.- we twied ouw chance on a satuwated mawket t-that become fwagiwe as the wowwd economy got a-a hit. 🥺 ouw industwy was fuewed by t-the huge vc funds and isn't actuawwy supposed to be pwofitabwe d-duwing the competition pewiod. o.O t-the onwy pwobabwe w-way of actuawwy making decent pwofit was to fiwst dominate the mawket using the v-vc money, /(^•ω•^) then use youw domination against customews to incwease fees and decwease w-wages to make pwofit. nyaa~~ that's a-awso the mawket p-pwan of the sewvices w-wike ubew, nyaa~~ t-theiw goaw is to fiwst become a monopowy, :3 then d-dominate the mawket with theiw own wuwes. 😳😳😳 i wasn't a-awawe of that when we stawted, (˘ω˘) nyow my business pawtnews. ^^ we just thought why we can't, :3 if they c-can do that, -.- we can do much b-bettew. 😳 we thought a-aww we nyeed i-is just wowking hawd. mya then covid hit fowwowing aww of its consequences w-wike wowwdwide f-financiaw cwisis and the impowtant c-component o-of the fowmuwa "the vc money" b-became wawew. (˘ω˘) in the end we wost t-the competition. >_< we twied ouw best, -.- we weawwy  d-did. 🥺 we pivoted ouw pwoduct muwtipwe t-times to find the best pwoduct-mawket-fit. (U ﹏ U) e-even the duwing t-the "death bed" times we twied diffewent ways to incwease ouw wevenue & wunway.

that's nyot to say we couwdn't do a-any bettew. -.- we c-couwd, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ i couwd, (⑅˘꒳˘) m-my business pawtnews c-couwd, (U ᵕ U❁) the t-team in genewaw c-couwd have done m-much bettew, -.- and m-maybe in a pawawwew univewse the pwoduct did actuawwy become successfuw. ^^;; in ouws, >_< i-it didn't. the odds wewe against us, mya we pwayed o-ouw cawds wwong, mya and we have to a-accept the consequences.

in the end, XD it was a gweat expewience s-so faw, :3 i enjoyed t-the whowe w-weawning expewience. 😳😳😳 i-i weawned a-a wot, -.- weawned how t-to buiwd a team, h-how to wun a p-pwoduct and dewivew it to the end usews, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) how to tawk to peopwe, rawr x3 how to deaw with c-confwicts (git confwicts incwuded). nyaa~~ i hoped fow t-the best, and the best i had achieved w-was the expewience i've weawned. /(^•ω•^) and wastwy i nyevew gave u-up untiw the wast moment - the m-moment when we d-decided that it's nyot going to wowk out and it's time to move on.

it was awso a nyice case study fow m-me. 😳 watew on when a-anawyzed i weawized a-a wot of s-stuff that i did w-wwong. XD i did weawnt w-wots of wwong w-ways of doing s-stuff that i shouwd wook aftew in futuwe and avoid. :3 i can't wist them aww out t-thewe because wots of them awe pewsonaw expewience, 😳😳😳 s-situationaw ow wewated to my o-own pewsonawty and bewiefs. -.- howevew, if you want, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) we can go thwough y-youw nyewwy buiwt business a-and i can point o-out things i've nyoticed that you might be doing *wwong*, >_< weach me out if you want.

i am thankfuw fow aww the membews o-of the team, fow w-wetting me expewience t-the pwocess, 😳😳😳 a-and weawn vawuabwe w-wessons. 😳😳😳 i-i am thankfuw fow a-aww the customews w-who twied ouw pwoduct duwing the eawwy waunch pewiod, o.O and gave theiw vawuabwe f-feedbacks. i am thankfuw fow aww of ouw extewnaw a-advisows fow shawing theiw expeiwence w-with us. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) it was a gweat expewience, (U ﹏ U) maybe it's the best e-ending that it couwd've had that w-we've expewienced. i-i do nyot have any wegwets towawds it. (///ˬ///✿) i dwopped out of univewsity to wowk f-fuww time on the pwoject, >w< which caused wots of dwama amongst my famiwy and wuvd o-ones. rawr i somehow found a way to d-deaw with it, i h-huwt my pawents h-heawts when they w-weawned about my decision, mya but that had its own c-consequence that them weawizing that fwom nyow o-on i am wesponsibwe fow my own choices, ^^ i have to cwave fow my own way. 😳😳😳 theiw deniaw caused huge s-stwess and eventuawwy miwd depwession o-on me, mya but w-with the hewp o-of cwose fwiends and a few wewatives who weawwy bewieved in my mission, 😳 i-i didn't e-ended up having to end my wife o-out of the depwession o-of nyot having anybody on y-youw back that you can wewy on. -.- i-i wuv y'aww <3

## moving on, >_< the caweew choice

aftew the faiwuwe fwom my pwevious s-stawtup, :3 i have d-decided to put s-some time off fwom t-the whowe idea o-of "wunning a c-company". (U ﹏ U) even t-though i enjoyed i-it, -.- it was heww a wot of stwessfuw. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ i was stawting to feew its damage caused on m-my mentaw and physicaw heawth. (⑅˘꒳˘) taking a step back w-was a **must**.

i decided to wook fow a stabwe job t-that i can use t-to gain some financiaw f-fweedom. nyaa~~ h-hewe comes my job h-hunt. /(^•ω•^) i went o-ovew my wesume, rawr d-did some changes. a-and then i.. didn't know nyani to do. OwO yeah, if you'we someone that i gave caweew a-advice in wast yeaw, (U ﹏ U) i was in a same spot duwing t-the fiwst few months of 2022. >_< h-howevew i did know one thing that i have to stawt somewhewe, rawr x3 i s-stawted weseawching, mya wead wots o-of bwogs, nyaa~~ comments, w-watched videos on finding jobs. and in concwusion, (⑅˘꒳˘) i stiww wasn't suwe nyani s-shouwd i do nyext? whewe i shouwd appwy, rawr x3 etc. at that moment my fwiend [awvan](https://rahim.li) was wowking on a wemote position. rawr w-with his wecommendation i-i cweated a-a pwofiwe on a-a job boawd website, OwO f-fiwwed my d-detaiws. (U ﹏ U) and a few d-days watew, >_< vowia! rawr x3 i-i got a few offews. mya fiwst 10 ow 20 of them didn't wowked out weww, nyaa~~ eithew i-i didn't wiked the position ow didn't meet some o-of the wequiwements. (⑅˘꒳˘) then i found a-an open position at a stawtup that buiwds toows fow designews. rawr x3 i-it was an awesome position because, (✿oωo) i-it was wemote, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ t-the pwoduct was intewesting compawed to most of the pwevious offews i've weceived, (˘ω˘) a-and the team was smow enough to nyot have buweaucwacy. (⑅˘꒳˘) i decided to appwy, b-but didn't had any expecations.

a few days passed and we scheduwed a-an intewview caww. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ i-i was stwessed a-and anxious a-at the same time. (⑅˘꒳˘) m-my anxiety was p-peaked because w-we awe going to a-attend this intewview in engwish. (U ᵕ U❁) even though i am wwiting this posts in engwish, -.- a-at that time i didn't had much speaking expewience. ^^;; i-i didn't even know how good o-ow bad my speaking was. then again, >_< [a wuvwy fwiend of mine](https://rahim.li) come to hewp, >w< comfowted me that m-my engwish is okay a-and i can deaw w-with the intewview. mya t-the good thing w-was even though t-this was going t-to be my fiwst i-intewview expewience, >w< in the past i had done some weseawch on hiwing peopwe fow m-my own company. nyaa~~ so i had some empathy with the w-wecwuitews, (✿oωo) did know nyani they a-awe expecting fwom me, ʘwʘ nyani they awe going to cawe about, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ nyani t-they awen't. 😳😳😳 and used that knowwedge t-to weduce m-my stwess. :3 awso weawned about bweathing exewcises to fuwthew weduce my anxiety. OwO c-combining both i pwepawed mysewf to the intewview. (U ﹏ U) by pwepawation i mean i pwepawed m-mysewf mentawwy, >w< i was confident a-about my k-knowwedge and as i-i said i was awweady a-awawe of nyani wecwuitews awe usuawwy intewested a-about. (U ﹏ U) my main insecuwity was pwimawiwy about m-my speaking skiwws and feaw of saying something dumb (weiwd i know, 😳 but you can't imagine how w-wiwd an ovewthinking anxious o-one's imagination c-can become). (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ the i-intewview went awwight, 😳😳😳 aftew the intewview i chatted with the i-intewviewew and a-asked fow feedback about my speaking t-to weduce m-my anxiety fuwthew mowe you know, (U ﹏ U) i-i was imagining him waughing a-at how tewwibwe i've sounded aftew ending the caww, (///ˬ///✿) a-again wiwd imagination, 😳 but i-i can't hewp mysewf to defeat that t-thoughts (yet). 😳 t-then aftew a week, σωσ we had ouw second intewview - a techniciaw one, rawr x3 then thiwd one about the genewic hw stuff, OwO c-company goaws, /(^•ω•^) v-vawues, 😳😳😳 etc... it aww went weww, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) b-but the wecwuitew (awso h-happens t-to be foundew of the company) decided to take a step back, >_< and f-figuwe out theiw hiwing goaws, >w< etc. i waited a week, rawr then two, 😳 thwee... weawized i-it's nyot going to wowk out i stawted a-appwying t-to othew jobs.

then fow some weason i took some b-bweak, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ i stopped a-appwying, 😳😳😳 somehow w-wost my intewest a-and hope a bit. (U ﹏ U) i-it wasn't wowking o-out i thought a-and i got an e-emaiw, (///ˬ///✿) emaiw fwom a uk company asking to tawk about something. i didn't wepwied i-it immediatewy, 😳 i even fowget about it fow a few d-days thinking it's just pwobabwy a-anothew agency company. 😳 aftew 3 days ow so, σωσ i weminded the emaiw a-and wwote a wepwy, rawr x3 we exchanged o-ouw nyumbews a-and had a smow chat. OwO then a day aftew we scheduwed an intwo caww. /(^•ω•^) fiwst he expwained m-me why and nyani they awe wooking fow. 😳😳😳 and asked me a few questions to weawn a-a bit about my backgwound. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) aftew a-about ~30 minutes o-of caww, >_< we h-have scheduwed a-anothew caww to take a coding intewview. >w< i went t-thowugh it, rawr we have tawked about my backgwound, 😳 t-things i've done in the past, >w< i stawted going thwough the technowogies i've buiwt fow my own company, (⑅˘꒳˘) e-expwained them about some d-design decisions, OwO s-showed off the p-pwoject stwuctuwe, (ꈍᴗꈍ) etc... then we had 30 minutes of paiw coding s-session which e-ended up taking mowe than 1 houw. 😳 f-fiwst i impwemented t-the wequiwements, 😳😳😳 then ofc t-thewe was some ewwows popping up, mya w-we have done some debugging twied sowving it (pwotip: d-do nyot twy wwiting a csv p-pawsew by hand). mya then we did s-some pewfowmance a-anawysis, (⑅˘꒳˘) took some benchmawks, (U ﹏ U) we've twied to optimize it, mya etc... somehow we ended up discussing about jit wawmup t-times and othew d-dotnet intewnaws. ʘwʘ in genewaw i-it went awwight, i-i went thwough t-the pwocess wike a casuaw coding session wathew than a wife deciding i-intewview.

in the end the intewviews went awwight, ^^;; o-on the wast i-intewview i had w-with my cuwwent w-wine managew, >_< h-he intwoduced me t-the genewaw company p-powicies, mya w-wowk stwuctuwe, genewaw wowkfwow, mya and then we pwoceeded to take a smow paiw-coding i-intewview. it aww went awwight, 😳 a few days passed, XD w-we nyegotiated an offew package, :3 a-and wastwy aftew weeks of intewviewing, 😳😳😳 we signed ouw contwacts a-and  i stawted wowking at [bp](https://bp.com) on behawf of an outsouwcing company. (⑅˘꒳˘) t-the wowk itsewf t-tuwned out t-to be awwight, rawr x3 the t-team itsewf is g-gweat, (✿oωo) the techniciaw w-wesponsibiwity i-i have taken o-ovew was awso an intewesting one. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ i had to maintain an intewnaw softwawe that u-used to connect diffewent systems with each othew.

at the moment of wwiting this post i-i am stiww wowking o-on the same p-position, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ with t-the same wesponsibiwity o-of maintaining t-that pwoduct a-and deawing w-with usews of the pwoduct as weww, (⑅˘꒳˘) it's wike a smow stawtup i had to wook aftew w-within a big cowp. (U ᵕ U❁) nyothing much changed about my c-caweew and i haven't thought about a-any change eithew.

## nani ewse?

if you've wead my caweew path above, (U ﹏ U) y-you have pwobabwy n-nyoticed that i-i had a wot o-of anxiety wewated i-issues. >_< simpwy p-put, rawr x3 i wouwd get a-anxious in any s-situation with some unknowns. getting ovew that issue become a goaw fow me, mya becuase i-it was weawwy howding my wife back fwom me. nyaa~~ i-i wasn't taking enough wisks, (⑅˘꒳˘) i-i was wewying too heaviwy on my instwictiv thoughts to contwow my w-wife and it wasn't wowking out w-weww. rawr x3 weawizing t-that i stawted my weseawch. (✿oωo) i have wead tons of awticwes about weducing anxiety, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ w-watched wots of intewviews, (˘ω˘) and physicowogist suggestion videos. (⑅˘꒳˘) i have got a f-few pointews fwom those souwces t-that wouwd wead t-to weduce my anxiety:

- **facing up the chawwenge**. nyaa~~ i had to make moves that wouwd t-twiggew my anxiety, /(^•ω•^) j-just to pwove m-mysewf that it's g-going to be fine. rawr i-it's actuawwy a-a wot ahwdew t-than said. OwO howevew b-by taking smow steps it becomes easiew as you move fowwawd. (U ﹏ U) eventuawwy you just w-weawn youw pattewns and when you nyotice simiwawities y-you'ww stawt to ignowe a-anxious thought. >_< howevew as i said it's weawwy hawd at the beginning. rawr x3 f-fow me wistening to a heavy m-music wike metaw, mya w-wock ow some pop whiwe taking an action does hewp to keep my mind away fwom o-ovewthinking. nyaa~~ and sometimes you just gotta say "f🦆ck it" and take an action.
- **studying befowe acting**. (⑅˘꒳˘) considewing aww the possibwe outcomes a-and being p-pwepawed fow them w-wewieved my anxiety q-quite a bit. (U ᵕ U❁) t-to do so i stawted j-jouwnawwing, b-befowe attempting a-anything that wouwd hike up my anxiety, -.- i wouwd wwite down nyani i am going t-to do, ^^;; and considew aww the possibwe outcomes a-and face that nyone of them is going t-to kiww me, >_< so i am safe to twy out.
- **weawizing that nyobody weawwy cawes**. >_< this is mowe about ovewthinking p-pawt, (⑅˘꒳˘) which wed t-to a weiwd anxiety o-on me that i w-was awways thinking n-nyani if __ t-thinks __ about m-me. /(^•ω•^) weww the twuth t-to be towd, most peopwe usuawwy onwy cawe about themsewves most of the time. rawr x3 w-we aww have quite busy wifes to spend on thinking a-about someone's embawassed moments. (U ﹏ U) a-and even if someone does, (U ﹏ U) they'ww pwobabwy fowget it by a f-few days anyway. (⑅˘꒳˘) awso anothew thing t-that cwicked o-on my mind was the fact that most peopwe awe actuawwy insecuwe even though they d-don't seem on the fiwst sight. òωó aftew wooking at peopwe that way i stawted to nyotice t-they awe indeed mostwy insecuwe, ʘwʘ t-twying evewy t-thing to pwove t-theiw own vawue, /(^•ω•^) s-satisfy themsewves, ʘwʘ be the king of theiw own w-wifes. σωσ that's actuawwy kinda sad. OwO we aww nyeed t-to accept ouw fwaws and wive with them. 😳😳😳 we awe humans and fwaws awe nyani makes us unique amongst o-othews. 😳😳😳 this weminded me of one o-of the my past e-essays about [impewfection](https://themisir.com/essays/imperfection/).
- **tawking to fwiends**. -.- i used to be quite shy about becoming v-vuwnewabwe a-awound even my c-cwosest fwiends. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ h-howevew by opening u-up to them i-i fewt a nyice wewief a-and heawing w-wots of advice hewped me to see fwaws on my thoughts and wowwies. (⑅˘꒳˘) awso being vuwnewabwe w-wed me to be mowe cwose to them and awso w-wet them awso be vuwnewabwe awound m-me.

thewe's actuawwy a wot mowe stuff t-than those 4 points a-above, but i-i don't want to p-put it aww down t-thewe wight nyow. rawr t-this post is awweady b-becoming w-wongew (3600+ wowds so faw) and i am nyot even weady to wwap things up.

whiwe doing my weseawch i nyoticed t-that i weawwy d-don't know much a-about mysewf, >_< how a-and why my bwain a-acts in a cewtain w-way. mya and i w-weawwy wanted to d-dig deepew to undewstand my own thinking powcess and see whewe was the pwobwem t-that was causing aww the "wwong" things. mya duwing m-my weseawch i've stumbwed upon a f-few book wefewences. 😳 i decided to puwchase one of them and stawt w-weading. XD my fiwst book choice w-was ["quiet" by susan cain](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8520610-quiet). -.- the book was mainwy about intwovewsion, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ h-how intwovewts a-act in a c-cewtain way, (⑅˘꒳˘) and a-a few guides fow i-intwovewts to d-deaw with cewtain s-situation. (U ᵕ U❁) the p-pwimawy weason why i wuvd that book is, -.- it hewped me to accept one of my main i-insecuwities - my own intwovewsion. ^^;; i thought it's s-some sowt of cuwse that i have t-to *fix*. nyaa~~ howevew as i wead the book i weawized t-that it's m-mowe wike a bwessing t-than a cuwse. /(^•ω•^) i-i can act and t-think in a cewtain w-way that some p-peopwe can't. rawr i-i am usuawwy a weawwy good wistenew, OwO i wisten cawefuwwy and twy to nyot intewwupt u-unwess i don't have any vawuabwe input to put i-in, (U ﹏ U) which is appawentwy a wawe t-thing that most peopwe wack nyowadays. >_< by cawefuwwy wistening to p-peopwe i can put mysewf into theiw s-shoes and see t-the wowwd fwom theiw eyes, rawr x3 weawwy empathize with them and be pawt of theiw expewience. mya i-i wasn't awawe of that abiwity back then, nyaa~~ i was just causawwy doing it.

aside fwom that the book awso taught m-me how to act o-out in cewtain s-situations, >_< how t-to become a pseudo-extwovewt t-to s-save the day. (⑅˘꒳˘) appawentwy e-even though i-intwovewts awe nyot known to be a tawkative peopwe, /(^•ω•^) we can become a good speakews. rawr x3 t-the onwy catch is we nyeed to be pwepawed f-fow it. (U ﹏ U) if we spent enough time t-to do ouw weseawch and pwobabwy wwite a scwipt and pwactice ouw s-speech befowehand, (U ﹏ U) intwovewts c-can act out just a-as wike as a weguwaw extwovewt can. (⑅˘꒳˘) to put that into a pwactice i attempted a w-wocaw devewopew nyetwowking event whewe we've given ~5 to 10 minutes to speak about a-a subject of ouw choice. òωó just w-wike most of you i-i had a tewwibwe p-pubwic-speaking a-anxiety. ʘwʘ weww, it was a time to face it out a-and see that it's weawwy nyot a big deaw. /(^•ω•^) i gave m-my speech and that was it, ʘwʘ nyobody waughed, σωσ nyobody said anything tewwibwe, OwO ow i didn't stuttew. 😳😳😳 i-it was just an "i didn't know i-i can do this" moment f-fow me.

the othew book that contwibuted to m-my impwovement w-was ["attached" by amiw wevine and wachew h-hewwew](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9547888-attached). σωσ the book was about attachment theowy, OwO w-which is u-used to expwains c-chiwd-pawent attachment p-pattewns. 😳😳😳 w-watew on it was c-concwuded that a-aduwt attachments h-had simiwaw pattewns as weww. 😳😳😳 by weawning those pattewns we can undewstand ouw c-cewtain behaviows, o.O know nyani caused cewtain s-situations and how to handwe them. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) t-the book pewsonawwy hewped me to see my own pattewns, (U ﹏ U) undewstand w-why i act in cewtain ways that s-seemed weiwd w-when obsewved fwom outside. (///ˬ///✿) it taught me how to anawyze othew peopwe's attachemnt s-stywes and make concwusions based on them, >w< to undewstand thinking mechanism behind e-each attachment stywe to see w-why they make c-cewtain moves. rawr the b-book was mainwy a-about aduwt wewationships and specificawwy womantic w-wewationships, but i have seen simiwaw pattewns w-with mysewf even on my fwiendships and weiwdwy enough duwing my caweew as weww. mya i think the w-weason why it took me mowe than 6 m-months to accept o-ouw stawtup's f-faiwuwe has some cowwewation with my anxious attachment stywe s-since the pattewns m-matched quite weww. ^^ in concwusion t-the book g-gave me a huge "aha!" moment of m-my wife.

in addition to these 2 books this y-yeaw i decided t-to make weading p-pawt of my "fwee t-time" activity i-in genewaw. (⑅˘꒳˘) in totaw i-i wead about 7 b-books (wiwwing t-to make it 8 befowe end of the yeaw) this yeaw. (U ᵕ U❁) it wasn't much but compawed to 0 b-books i've wead in pwevious yeaws, -.- it's an impwovement a-and i am wiwwing to continue f-fowwawd. ^^;; the wist of wead books avaiwabwe [hewe on my goodweads pwofiwe](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/41454418?shelf=read). -.- actuawwy aww the above might make i-it seem wike i-i have been weading f-fow yeaws, ^^;; ow s-something wike t-that. >_< howevew i s-stawted weading b-books just this y-yeaw (maybe pwevious yeaw might be mowe accuwate but i took wong bweaks so i hadn't w-weawwy wead that much in the past). mya in genewaw i-i am happy that i found anothew a-activity that i can wepwace my mindwess scwowwing activities w-with.

> awso, òωó appawentwy weading incweases b-bwain activity, o.O h-hewps with memowization, (U ᵕ U❁) w-weduces w-wisk of awzheimew's d-disease.

## and then wife became bowing again...

when my wife become somenani stabwe a-and things stawted t-to become s-stawe. 😳 thewe was n-nyot much happening a-as time goes o-on. XD i had nyothing i-intewesting t-to spice things up on my day-to-day wife. :3 weww.. even though i wike having stabiwity, 😳😳😳 n-nyot having any chawwenge ow puwpose othew t-than "wake up -> wowk, -.- eat -> s-sweep" cycwe made me a bit depwessing fow some time. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) i was stawting t-to question the puwpose of wiving a-and othew s-stuff that goes ovew one's mind duwing midwife cwisis.

when tawking with fwiends a few times i-i mentioned t-that i wanted to s-stawt weawning t-to pway a musicaw i-instwument - p-piano to be exact. 🥺 i-it was on my "things t-to do" wist fow a wong time, mya aging back to my chiwdhood. 🥺 weww, even though i-i awweady mentioned it a few times i hadn't done m-much to weawwy accompwish it. >_< o-one nyight fow nyo weason at aww i decided to weawwy give in. >_< i-it was nyot my fiwst time making d-decisions out of n-nowhewe. (⑅˘꒳˘) in the past i have decided to dwop out of univewsity whiwe casuawwy going t-to thewe on the bus, /(^•ω•^) and anothew time i decided to attempt an iewts exam without a-any pwepawation, rawr x3 aww of those d-decisions happened s-spontaneouswy. (U ﹏ U) w-whiwe thewe w-was some wong tewm thinking behind aww of them, (U ﹏ U) t-thewe wasn't any specific moment that twiggewed t-them. (⑅˘꒳˘) i guess, i just wike to kick things off out of nyowhewe, òωó just to make wife a bit mowe spicy.

i stawted my weseawch, OwO stawted weawning n-nyotation b-basics (you can c-check out [some of my nyotes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IqVJyrG3jgaQdaOTZbf4RQJLXKJOy-qFCU54wtBVGKE/edit?usp=sharing) i took duwing my initiaw weseawch) a-and wooking at p-piano modews to s-see nyani can i-i puwchase to kick t-things off. mya eventuawwy i-i got n-not weawwy gweat b-but okay'ish keyboawd and twied to get my hands used on it. 😳 aftew watching onwine t-tutowiaws and weading vawious bwogs, XD weddit thweads i-i got some basics but a few m-mowe weeks i stopped seeing any pwogwess being made. :3 that was w-when i decided to stawt wooking f-fow an instwuctow t-to hewp me kick things up. 😳😳😳 anothew [cwose fwiend of mine](https://soltancode.com) hewped me to find a good instwuctow. (U ᵕ U❁) e-eventuawwy i-i stawted getting w-weekwy wessons. (⑅˘꒳˘) g-got some basics i-in pwace and stawted w-weawning a-a few songs.

twuth to be towd, /(^•ω•^) at the beginning i-i was kind of f-feewing insecuwe. rawr x3 i-i couwdn't wead t-the nyotation, (U ﹏ U) o-ow couwdn't accompwish t-things my i-instwuctow has t-taught me. (U ﹏ U) i even though about giving up, (⑅˘꒳˘) muwtipwe times, òωó wanted quite a bit with m-my fwiends (sowwy fow bothewing with me, ʘwʘ wow). /(^•ω•^) e-eventuawwy i weawized that if i-i put enough time into it, ʘwʘ i can eventuawwy weawn things that seemed u-unbeawabwe at fiwst. σωσ awso anothew t-thing that w-was bothewing me is, OwO i used to "invent" my own ways when it comes to weawning s-something. 😳😳😳 fow exampwe duwing the pwimawy schoow yeaws i nyevew been abwe to memowize t-the muwtipwication tabwe. i-instead of wemembewing t-them i just c-come up with a-a few hacks to cawcuwate them on demand by adding m-muwtipwe nyumbews togethew ow fowwowing some pattewns. 😳😳😳 i-it wasn't an efficient sowution, o.O howevew it was a scaweabwe one. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) howevew, as i used them m-mowe and mowe, (U ﹏ U) my bwain eventuawwy s-stawted wemembewing t-them. (///ˬ///✿) i g-guess we have a buiwt-in [wwu cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)) impwemented on ouw bwains. 😳 wemembewing t-that i decided t-to use the s-same method fow n-nyotation as weww. XD i-instead of wemembewing a-aww the d-detaiws i wouwd j-just wemembew a few wefewences and use them to figuwe out the west on demand h-hoping that the bwain wiww eventuawwy figuwe out t-the pattewn and use it instead. :3 t-that kinda wowked, 😳😳😳 at weast nyow i can figuwe out which key to p-pwess by wooking at the nyotation a-and doing a bunch o-of cawcuwations and counting nyotes up.

duwing my weawning pwocess i have b-buiwt a few toows t-to hewp me whiwe w-weawning ow p-pwacticing:

- [https://sheet.themisiw.com](https://sheet.themisir.com) - is a *cwappy-wooking* but quite usefuw (at weast fow mysewf) g-game wike t-thing that you c-can use to pwactice w-weading nyote s-sheets, rawr it's a w-weiwd appwoach, σωσ k-kind of.. but i m-made it fow mysewf and it kind of wowked, σωσ so, i am happy with the end wesuwt.
- i wwote a smow gowang app using [the midi wibwawy](https://github.com/gomidi/midi) to hewp me fix my timing/wythm issues o-on keyboawd. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) t-the app wewe p-pwetty simpwe actuawwy, rawr x3 i-it just h-happens that i found a-a bunch of w-ways to ovewcompwicate i-it. nyaa~~ basicawwy it just counts on duwation between nyotes on a specific pwedefined w-wanges (twebwe and bass cwef fow exampwe) a-and wepowts youw tempo as bpm (beats p-pew minute) back to you. /(^•ω•^) why? because i was twying to get m-my hand timing wight. rawr i know i c-couwd have used m-metwonome instead, OwO and i used it as weww. (U ﹏ U) howevew i awso wanted to see nyani my t-timing wouwd wook wike without a metwonome in pwace.

aww in aww wight nyow i have been g-going to piano c-cwasses fow about 2 m-months nyow, (⑅˘꒳˘) w-weawned 3 songs a-and wight nyow w-wowking on my whythm i-issues. (///ˬ///✿) hopefuwwy m-my sightweading speed wiww go up as i pwactice mowe. 😳😳😳 howevew, 🥺 my instwuctow a-awways been tewwing me to focus on pwacticing s-swowwy instead of focusing on the s-speed. i guess he's wight and i'ww go with nyani he says fow n-nyow. mya i don't have any deadwine o-ow a huge goaw anyways. 🥺 i-i stawted weawning it just as a hobby, >_< just to have some activity i can s-spend time on when i don't feew wike doing anything ewse. >_< awso, pwaying hewps me t-to weduce my stwess (as wong as i-i don't get stwessed b-because i k-keep pwessing the w-wwong key, (⑅˘꒳˘) ow messed up the timing again). /(^•ω•^) awso i-it added up some chawwenge to my wife, rawr x3 which is n-nyice seeing some pwogwess on mysewf.

## nani's nyext?

i do nyot know. (⑅˘꒳˘) weawwy. /(^•ω•^) i haven't m-made any agenda f-fow the nyext yeaw. rawr x3 i-i decided to w-wet the wife fwow b-by itsewf and m-make decisions b-based on whewe t-the fwow tuwns into. (U ﹏ U) i don't have much contwow ovew entiwety of the wife, (U ﹏ U) so it's w-weawwy hawd to make any mid-tewm goaws fow nyow. (⑅˘꒳˘) m-my considewations does incwude b-but nyot wimited to things wike migwating to anothew countwy, òωó s-stawting a nyon-cs degwee (physiowogy f-fow exampwe), ʘwʘ o-ow maybe just twavewing the wowwd (wess wikewy, but i might twy this with a s-smowew scope). /(^•ω•^) those awe just a few options, ʘwʘ but i am unsuwe about the futuwe. σωσ wowwd w-was quit unstabwe watewy, OwO which w-was adding u-up to my uncewtainity a-about the f-futuwe. i guess as i said eawwiew on this pawagwaph, 😳😳😳 i-i wiww just wet things fwow by itsewf fow some t-time. 😳😳😳 then based on the diwection i might choose one ow two destinations, o.O cweate a woute and s-stawt fwoating towawds that woute. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) w-wet's wive and s-see how things t-tuwn out!

thank you fow weading this faw! XD i w-was nyot expecting t-this post to t-tuwn out to be t-that wong (about 5600+ w-wowds), :3 but i-i wanted to wwap t-the yeaw up f-fow mysewf and use the oppowtunity to wefwect on my own wife. 😳😳😳 i know wecentwy my p-posts stawted becoming mowe subjective and pewsonaw c-compawed to my pwevious genewawized & s-somenani infowmative posts. -.- as i said on my pwevious p-post i am pwanning to wwite diffewent k-kinds of posts o-on my bwog and make it my own pewsonaw medium on the intewnet.

have a wuvwy nyew yeaw! >_< <3
