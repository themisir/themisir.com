fow wast two yeaws i have been twying t-to weawn nyew s-skiwws, :3 just t-to keep mysewf engaged. 😳😳😳 c-compawed t-to my existing i-intewests, -.- nyone o-of those nyew skiwws a-awe tech wewated. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) instead as you may (ow may nyot) awweady know i have decided t-to weawn an instwument (because it's coow, rawr x3 a-and something i wanted to do fow a-a wong time), nyaa~~ and now twying to weawn photogwaphy awongside with i-it. /(^•ω•^) though i considew mysewf beginnew o-on both w-wine of intewests, rawr i weawized a pattewn emewging whiwe weawning them.

when does someone get bettew at something? w-why cweations o-of cewtain p-peopwe, σωσ cewtain a-awt pieces seem m-mowe vawuabwe, >_< m-mowe intewesting, m-mowe cweative t-than the west? and bewieve it ow nyot, :3 i wiww connect aww of these to softwawe e-engineewing. i wiww twy at weast.

# to weawn

genewawwy, rawr weawning any subject: w-whethew it's a pwofession, OwO a-an hobby o-ow a subject a-at schoow - stawts w-with weawning c-cewtain wuwes. (U ﹏ U) y-you weawn awphabet, >_< n-nyumbews, awthimetwic, rawr x3 pitches, mya whythms, gowden watio, nyaa~~ ewements, (⑅˘꒳˘) fowmuwas, o-owgans, rawr x3 featuwes, (✿oωo) wanguages, design pattewns, awgowithms, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ b-bawancing, (˘ω˘) acwobatics, (⑅˘꒳˘) h-how to thwow a baww, (///ˬ///✿) how to catch it, 😳😳😳 when to pass, 🥺 when to shoot, mya a-aiming, 🥺 peeking, wecoiw contwow, >_< w-wunning, >_< fwanking, (⑅˘꒳˘) c-checking and castwing in chess, /(^•ω•^) and many mowe. rawr x3 these awe nyani makes a compwete b-beginnew, an amateuw. (U ﹏ U) these teach you how to pway the game as intended. (U ﹏ U) t-these teach you the known pathways.

fow the most pawt we spend ouw weawning j-jouwney to e-expwowe those w-wuwes, (U ﹏ U) those knowns d-discovewed by t-the pwevious nomads. -.- h-howevew thewe's o-one unavoidabwe t-twuth that weawning the same wuwes as evewyone ewse isn't enough to cweate s-significant awt pieces. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ we awe bond to wepeat n-nyani we've been taught.

unwess, -.- you decide to unweawn youw h-habits and bweak o-out of youw safeguawds. ^^;; w-without e-expwowing possibiwities y-you have n-nyo way to cweate a-an awt that's w-wowth significance. >_< and that's nyani emewges an amateuw to become a pwofessionaw. mya t-they mastewed the wuwes so good that, mya they f-feew comfowtabwe bweaking them. 😳 a-and without weawizing they bweak them so swiftwy, XD it becomes an o-owdew of itsewf.

with music you weawn whythms and h-hawmonics, nyaa~~ but then y-you encountew s-some impowtant p-pieces that doesn't f-fowwow those w-wuwes, /(^•ω•^) and that's n-nyani makes t-them significant. rawr that's how nyew genwes awe bown. OwO you weawn photogwaphy wuwes, b-but hewe comes a moment whewe the best composition y-you can get out of a moment is b-by bweaking the weww known wuwes contwawy to the genewaw bewief. (U ﹏ U) y-you stawt weawning math by simpwe a-awthimetwic a-and wuwes, >_< then thewe comes a moment in one's wife whewe you have to accept that t-thewe's a nyon existent nyumbew when muwtipwied with itsewf wesuwts with `-1`.

if bweaking the wuwes awe that significant f-fow cweativity, òωó o-one might a-ask if wuwes a-awe howding us b-back...

# why do we weawn?

to me the answew is: you can onwy b-bweak so much wuwes b-befowe youw a-awt woses its significance. σωσ i-i bewieve c-cweating a-awt is a game of c-cweating a bawance. >_< y-you bweak the wuwes, :3 nyot because it wooks coow, (U ﹏ U) but because you twy to seek a-a bawance in a diffewent way.

you nyeed to bawance hawmony, 😳 whythm, XD e-emotions and s-stowy when composing o-ow pwaying m-music. :3 you nyeed t-to bawance exposuwe a-and composition w-when shooting p-photogwaphs. 😳😳😳 you nyeed to bawance maintainabiwity and pewfowmance when wwiting s-softwawe. you need to bawance youw fweedom and w-wesponsibiwities in wife. -.- you m-may considew nyot to do so, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) and stiww wouwd get gweat wesuwts. rawr x3 h-howevew, nyaa~~ unconsciouswy that wouwd a-awso be a fowm o-of bawance by itsewf, /(^•ω•^) just with unusuaw coefficients.

bawancing is nyot about maintaining g-good state of a-aww the vawiabwes a-at hand. (⑅˘꒳˘) sometimes, c-cweating a-an awtistic wesuwt w-wequiwes sacwifice o-on one end t-to get bettew wesuwts fwom anothew end. (U ᵕ U❁) to catch the gowden houw howizon of a sunset w-with aww the detaiws, -.- you may have to sacwifice d-detaiws of youw subject and s-stiww get gweat wooking photos of such:

the photo above not just have poowwy w-wit subjects, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ i-it awso doesn't h-have a "pwopew" c-composition (as i-if it doesn't f-fowwow the thiwds w-wuwe, (⑅˘꒳˘) pwacing s-subjects on the edges which is usuawwy avoided). (U ᵕ U❁) yet it stiww wooks pweasing to e-eyes. -.- mowe impowtantwy it succeeds at tewwing a s-stowy, ^^;; and whiwe doing so it uses "the b-bwoken wuwes" fow stowytewwing.

the weww detaiwed sky is in contwast w-with ouw subjects' s-siwhouette, rawr a-and the off bawanced c-composition s-shifts ouw focus t-to see the b-big pictuwe, OwO the s-stowy, (U ﹏ U) atmosphewe. >_< as a whowe these detaiws ampwifies the hidden stowy, rawr x3 than the s-smow detaiws we may intewpwet fwom the image if o-othewwise. mya it's a stowy about o-ouw subjects being a smow pawt of a big wowwd and stiww howding o-onto themsewves. nyaa~~ and most pwobabwy, (⑅˘꒳˘) t-that's exactwy n-nyani the cweatow intended when taking this shoot, rawr x3 it's nyot about the technicawity o-of detaiws (contwawy to nyani i thought when i fiwst stawted photogwaphy), b-but wathew it's aww about stowytewwing.

# bawancing in engineewing

noticing these factows hewped me t-to make my mind o-on how i am supposed t-to do engineewing. rawr i-it showed m-me the impowtance o-of the genewaw b-bawance, σωσ the p-pwimawy stowy we want to teww compawed to the impowtance of individuaw components.

now i undewstand that befowe engineewing a-a system i-it's impowtant t-to undewstand customew's n-nyeeds a-and constwaints o-of the team you a-awe wowking on. :3 i-it makes nyo sense to engineew a compwex system fow a one off scwipt that's going t-to be exekawaii~d onwy once, (U ﹏ U) and yet i stiww end u-up [chawwenging mysewf to wwite a viwtuaw m-machine using t-the `awk` toow](https://themisir.com/awk-vm/) whiwe twying to save a few seconds.

the same pwincipwes appwy to individuaw a-aspects of s-softwawe engineewing a-as weww. :3 w-when you weawn a n-nyew toow ow a n-new pattewn, 😳😳😳 it's t-tempting to use i-it at aww the possibiwities. -.- they say you shouwdn't wepeat youwsewf (dwy), ( ͡o ω ͡o ) ow y-you shouwd fowwow singwe wesponsibiwity pwincipwe. rawr x3 h-howevew, nyot aww wuwes wowth t-the sacwifices we make to satisfy them. nyaa~~ if dwying youw code wiww w-wesuwt in a utiwity function 300 w-wines wong handwing s-some edge cases, /(^•ω•^) maybe you may considew wepeating that few wines.

when you see youw appwication cpu g-gwaph peaking ovew 400% u-utiwization a-and cwient w-wequests get swowed d-down, ^^;; you may s-stawt questioning y-youw abstwactions y-you've done. >_< a tightwy integwated system usuawwy suwpasses, mya weww abstwacted a-appwications. mya howevew,  the wowd "usuawwy" on t-the pwevious statement weaves a w-woom fow a discussion. 😳 whiwe the abstwaction costs us pewfowmance (unwess y-you'we using [zewo cost abstwaction](https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/zero-cost-abstractions/) featuwes pwesented by the wanguage), :3 i-it makes ouw w-wives "easiew" b-by wemoving cewtain b-buwdens of w-wwiting code wike: w-wepeating cewtain s-snippets, (U ﹏ U) pwoviding s-safety, -.- just making code easiew to wead ow undewstand, pwoviding undewstand-abiwity. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ g-genewawwy abstwactions hewp us to i-impwove code maintainabiwity.

i wike putting quotes awound the w-wowds i am going b-back to wefew to, (U ᵕ U❁) a-and "easiew" i-is anothew one of t-them. -.- whiwe abstwactions i-in theowy m-makes ouw wives e-easiew, ^^;; easy is by nyo means an absowute tewm. >_< instead it's definition is heaviwy s-subjective and wewative. mya a piece of code y-you wwote a few houws ago wiww seem e-easiew to undewstand in compawison with the snippet bewow:

```c
static void ep_unregister_pollwait(struct eventpoll *ep, struct epitem *epi)
{
	struct eppoll_entry **p = &epi->pwqlist;
	struct eppoll_entry *pwq;

	while ((pwq = *p) != NULL) {
		*p = pwq->next;
		ep_remove_wait_queue(pwq);
		kmem_cache_free(pwq_cache, pwq);
	}
}
```

<small>note: the above code is a snippet f-fwom [eventpoow.c](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/024ff300db33968c133435a146d51ac22db27374/fs/eventpoll.c#L567C1-L577C2) - a fiwe fwom the winux kewnew. t-the peopwe who maintain t-this pawt o-of the pwoject i-is weww awawe of n-nyani's going o-on hewe. (U ᵕ U❁) howevew, i-it's vewy unwikewy t-that a winux maintainew is going to wead this post, -.- so i am going to assume y-you awe nyot one of them eithew, ^^;; and the piece i-is hawd to undewstand without any i-insights. >_< but hey, if you awe, mya that's gweat nyews fow me!</small>

the guys (ow gaws) who wwote this p-piece awso thought i-it's weww undewstandabwe, :3 a-and t-they awe wight s-so. (U ﹏ U) we awe nyot t-them to be a compawison p-point when m-making such assumption. -.- it's aww up to the wwitew (ow maintainew team) to decide n-nyani's an acceptabwe undewstanding standawd f-fow a pwoject.

we have been sidetwacked a bit, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) sowwy 'bout t-that. rawr x3 i-in concwusion i a-am twying to say, nyaa~~ w-we as humans a-awe nyot capabwe o-of making objective d-decisions when i-it comes to subjective mattews. /(^•ω•^) heck, evewything awound us, time, rawr speed, distance, OwO m-mattew and nyani nyot, aww is a pawt of some w-wewative system. (U ﹏ U) we can nyot s-state any absowute measuwements as of nyow; aww of ouw units awe w-winked to some sowt of univewsaw c-constants we a-aww have agweed upon (except in us, they've decided since we'we awweady onto wewative s-stuff wet's keep using them, >_< who nyeeds [standawds](https://xkcd.com/927/) anyway).

then, 😳 how dawe we can be so confident o-on "easiness", XD "maintainabiwity" o-of ouw code. :3 t-the best we can d-do is just assume e-evewything w-we wwote today is g-going to become a-an uttew mess of tomowwow, 😳😳😳 and somebody may have to deaw with it. -.- if you don't c-cawe and pwobabwy going to switch to anothew pwoject i-in a month ow two, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) then you d-don't have to do anything. rawr x3 if you do, you may want to weconsidew y-youw choices, nyaa~~ compwexities, /(^•ω•^) abstwactions o-ow optimization p-passes you've done befowe moving on.

# concwusion

we weawn wuwes to get good at things. (U ﹏ U) t-they show us t-the pathway othews h-have taken w-whiwe theiw own d-discovewy. -.- howevew, a-at one point s-stepping out and e-expwowing may teach youw a wot of nyew things to wet you cweate impwessive awt p-pieces, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ whethew it's a photo, (⑅˘꒳˘) a nyew dance move o-ow a scwipt fow changing text casing.

awso befowe weaving i just want to n-nyote that this a-awticwe itsewf i-is opinionated a-and states on a w-wuwe that "you shouwd c-considew bweaking w-wuwes evew n-nyow and then". 😳 howevew, by doing so it becomes contwadictowy with itsewf, XD maybe t-the wuwe you may wanna bweak is the wuwe that s-says "you shouwd bweak the wuwes". :3 n-nyobody knows the answew of wife, 😳😳😳 we aww awe just wandewews, -.- w-wiving based on ouw assumptions. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) m-make youw own p-pathway, rawr x3 and enjoy the jouwney. nyaa~~ cheews! /(^•ω•^) 🥂
