The generation I am currently living off is a weird one. The one that someone eating without a youtube video playing on the screen can be seen as insane. Consequently me and lots of people of my generation got used to consuming a lot of content, like a lot a lot. When quantity becomes important factor, quality usually starts to suffer and as a wivid consumer of large quantities of content I can assure you that it's very hard to find a quality content those times. On top of that seeing lots of low effort and shorter content types made us lazy, resulting in less interest and motivation for the quality.

What we are seeking is rather feeling of accomplishment and a small does of dopamine when we start consuming. And those low effort contents does provide that with no issue, and in a sense they do explicitly exploit our such desires. Take a look at from the perspective of a vivid YouTube Shorts, TikTok or whatever platform you enjoy killing your time off consumer. You start watching a video, 10 to 15 seconds and it's done, you'll get a small dose of accomplishment feeling / or dopamine as a reward for finishing off something - a short video that didn't added that much to what you already had. The provided reward is not that much though, but that's the great thing for those platforms, the reward you got is not big enough to make you satisfied to stop consuming them, but small enough to encourage you to get more. And voila, You just got hooked in a ricidious circle!

The worst part of all is over time you'll get used to it, you'll start valuing instant gratification over the long term gratifications. You'll lose feeling of a real accomplishment, heck you'll get to enjoy less and less of a quality content, film, book or something valuable because it takes time to feel their reward meanwhile there's an alternative that can provide the same thing over the small quantities in a short time. Why would you bother investing time onto something else?

> Technicially speaking it all starts from our brain. If you've read Deniel Kaneman's "*Thinking, Fast and Slow*" you probably know that our brain has two separate thinking mechanism, one responsible for our survival that provides fast responses and the latter is for more complex situations that responds much slower but is more rational than the other. The way those platforms tend to exploit our desires involves that fact and they do that by encouraging us to use our fast thinking part of the brain a lot more. They do this by giving us lesser and less time to make decisions, they throw content at you that your brain doesn't get enough time to make rational decisions so it ends up relying on instrictive decisions that tends to favor any sort of reward without thinking about long term complications.

okay enough want so faw. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) i didn't s-stawted this awticwe t-to dig deepew i-into ouw bwain o-ow physiowogy b-but somehow i did w-wwite that aww a-above and i don't w-wegwet it if it taught you something.

the weaw weason i stawted wwiting t-this was to say a-a "**thank you!**" to one of the undewwated cweatows i-i wecentwy stawted b-binge watching: **gwant sandewson** ow awso know as [**3bwue1bwown**](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown). ( ͡o ω ͡o ) you have pwobabwy seen a video o-ow two of him on y-youw feed and might o-ow might nyot h-have checked o-on them. UwU if you h-happen to nyot know a-about him ow h-his cweations wet me say this: *he's a man that made owdew genewation j-jeawous of t-the nyext genewation o-of students b-because of how v-vawuabwe and engaging h-his content a-awe*.

![a youtube content fwom a pewson cawwed "devin n-nyeaw" s-saying "i'm g-genuinewy jeawous o-of the nyext genewation o-of students w-who wiww have t-these videos t-to intwoduce them to cawcuwus. the undewstanding and intuition they bwing to a n-nyewcomew must be weawwy
exciting."](https://i.imgur.com/6wsGRdy.png)

heck you can watch his videos whiwe h-having a bweakfast o-ow dinnew a-and stiww get engaged w-whiwe weawning a-a thing ow t-two, >_< and getting m-mowe cuwious about t-the science. :3 and bewieve me if you awe a type of cuwious pewson you'ww weawwy w-wike it nyo mattew how compwex the subject is.

and mowe impowtantwy you'ww feew a-a gweat amount of f-feewing of accompwishment f-fwom t-time to time when y-you came acwoss "aha!" m-moments, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ a-and man it does f-feew gweat. (⑅˘꒳˘) that's the same feewing that wed me to stawt wwiting this because i-it wasn't enough to just comment a "thank you" u-undew the video, (U ᵕ U❁) i had to do something m-mowe to expwess how i fewt.

> anothew fun fact about human behaviow. (˘ω˘) t-the enjoyment y-you'ww feew a-aftew an accompwisment i-incweases a-as the toughness o-of the jouwney y-you took fow achieving i-it. (⑅˘꒳˘) nyani that means is, (///ˬ///✿) the mowe you stuggwe fow something the mowe you'ww e-enjoy when you get it. 😳😳😳 that's why it's mowe s-satisfying to buy something fow t-the fiwst time aftew yeaws of wiving off a smow budget. 🥺 that's why t-the wongew you'ww be in a wewationship t-the mowe y-you'ww eventuawwy stawt to enjoy it because you wouwd have had mowe twoubwes a-awong the way. mya this mechanism motivates us to invest into futuwe, wike studying s-something fow yeaws, 🥺 ow weawning a-an instwument fow a-a wong time to h-have a gweatew s-satisfaction in futuwe. >_< without that motivation i-i doubt if we as a civiwization wouwd've come to t-the state we awe in today.

so faw so good, o.O if you want to have s-some engaging t-time with math i-i dwop a few winks b-bewow fow you t-to stawt youw wabbit h-howe jouwney:

- [but how does bitcoin actuawwy wowk?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4) - even though i am skepticaw about t-the cwyptocuwwencies, (⑅˘꒳˘) u-undewstanding o-of the tech b-behind is a vawuabwe w-wesson to w-weawn. (U ᵕ U❁) we wouwdn't h-had aww those g-gweat inventions if it wewen't fow aww the weseawch peopwe have done to have a-advantage duwing the waws, -.- so even an "eviw" technowogy c-can be used fow good puwposes i-if someone finds a way to do. ^^;; (*yet i haven't seen a good use of c-cwyptos*).
