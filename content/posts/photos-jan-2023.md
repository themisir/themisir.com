I was having a regular day. Just before it hit 10pm, I got somewhat bored at home. I didn't know how to keep myself engaged. For a moment I had lost the joy out of the life. Then I decided to go out and have some walk while listening to some music on headphones. So I did. While having walk I wanted to take some photos and do some experiments with it. To be honest photography is one of the things I want to get good at eventually. That's why I am trying to photoshoot every moment I find that might be interesting. I try to find a good angles, interesting frames, weird viewpoints and all the other stuff that might worth looking at.

Just a small note that, those photos are probably not that good. Even probably worse than an average photo on your own gallery, but I don't care. Really. All I wanted is to take photos that seemed good to me, so I can compare them a few years later and see if I learned a thing or two during that time period. Less talking, let's dive into those photos.

## Found this cool, Can't think of any caption tho

A photo from the POV of a bench after a rainy day. Looks kind of like a road. A road with turns and twists. Just like a life huh...

## Stairs to the Enlightenment

I wish the photo itself was as cool as the caption...

## I don't know why I have done this

I might have just found this cool, I am not sure, but here we are! At first it looked interesting, but now that I take it another look, it's kinda boring. I like greens, so that's a thing (not the color, purple is my favourite one, but I like greens as grass or leaves of trees).

## A wooden bird house

I am not sure if it's actually called a "bird house" or not. I am not even sure if the thing on the photo is actually a functional bird house or just a prop. Take a look and scroll to the next one I guess...

## I found this frame cool

Nature inspires me a lot to continue living. There's a lot to be discovered, yet we are very busy within our own heads with small problems we create ourselves. Meanwhile nature out there making wonders, continuously living and dying. Just like us, maybe?

## An empty park

Actually, it wasn't empty when I got there. However, during shooting this frame there wasn't nobody around. I wish I would've put more effort into creating symmetry while shooting this one. I tried, but I was trying to not seem weird to the people walking around.

## An empty bench after the rain

With a bit of color correction this pic might have actually looked much better. I am too lazy to deal with that though. I kind of started liking taking photos from close-up angles though.

## Boy, do I like taking close-up bench photos

Same as above, I liked this one a lot more though.
