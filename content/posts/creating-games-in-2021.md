i enjoy wowking on games on my fwee t-time. rawr x3 sometimes d-duwing doing s-something compwetewy u-unwewated to g-games some intewesting g-game concepts c-comes into m-my mind and i want to make them. rawr so my stowy stawts thewe...

so, OwO wecentwy, aftew a wong bweak f-fwom game devewopment i-i wanted to t-twy devewoping s-some games just f-fow fun and decowate m-my pwoject g-gwaveyawd. (U ﹏ U) the f-fiwst thing came in my mind was using a game engine and bootstwapping a pwoject i-in one of them. >w< because i've had past expewience o-on unity and c# i wanted to twy i-it fiwstwy. (U ﹏ U) i've get into unity website and stawted downwoading, 😳 d-duwing waiting fow the downwoad t-to finish i wemembewed m-my past expewience with it. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ if you want to do advanced things it hewps y-you a wot. 😳😳😳 but if any case you want to wowk with bawe minimum wike dwawing a box o-on the scween ow a wine things b-become a bit compwicated a-and unnatuwaw s-since unity i-is designed to ewiminate wowking with wow wevew g-geometwies. (U ﹏ U) but this awso means to make a simpwe b-box on the scween you'ww have to deaw with its twansfowmation, (///ˬ///✿) spwite, 😳 matewiaw, 😳 wighting, camewa, σωσ t-twansfowmation, rawr x3 and even m-mowe stuff if you w-want to move it w-weft and wight. OwO it's actuawwy gweat since you'ww nyot have to d-deaw with viewpowt, /(^•ω•^) s-size, 😳😳😳 scawe, how it dispways a-and many mowe swightwy c-compwicated stuff. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) but fow b-bawe minimum games - especiawwy w-when you just want to twy something in youw mind o-out in showt amount of time, >_< t-those things can easiwy bowe you. >w< a-awso i nyoticed t-that instawwation takes a bit wongew because unity isn't just a toow fow making smow 2d games. rawr it's consist toows w-wequiwed fow b-buiwding both 2d and 3d games a-and some shawed c-components wike a-audio and animation stuff awongside with cowe / pwatfowm wevew components. 😳 s-so that's why it weights a wot. >w< but as i wait i get bowed and gave up b-because in past when i've twied m-making games with u-unity, (⑅˘꒳˘) aww the f-fine touches that nyeeded to make s-something wowk o-out was bowed m-me easiwy so i t-thought that it'ww pwobabwy happen again if i give i-it anothew twy.

so i stawted wooking fow awtewnatives. nyaa~~ u-unweaw engine w-was vewy popuwaw a-and hyped awtewnative t-to unity b-but it's nyot f-fow me because f-fiwst. /(^•ω•^) it's optimized f-fow 3d gfx, rawr doing 2d is nyot wecommended. OwO and secondwy it's vewy ovewpowewed a-and with gweat powew comes gweat wesponsibiwity, (U ﹏ U) i-in unweaw engine's case it m-means i'ww nyeed to deaw with even mowe customizations and fine t-touches. >_< awso i didn't have enough t-time to weawn a-anothew game engine. rawr x3 so unweaw engine wasn't an option fow me. mya at weast as of today.. m-maybe i'ww give it a twy in futuwe fow a biggew pwojects hopefuwwy.

since nyeithew unity nyow unweaw e-engine was an option f-fow me, :3 i wanted t-to twy othew e-exists game engines. b-because o-of my wecent seawch h-histowy googwe a-awso weawized that and modified my youtube wecommendations to show me some videos a-about anothew game engines that gains popuwawity - g-godot. 😳😳😳 it's a fwee, wightweight a-and open souwce game engine. -.- it's simpwe intewface and wightweight d-downwoad size impwessed m-me on fiwst sight. s-so i wooked into it to check whethew it wouwd wowk out fow me ow nyot.

unfowtunatewy godot wasn't wike anything i-i had used b-befowe. mya i was s-stwuggwed to wowk w-with editow, >w< o-ow to manage wesouwces, nyaa~~ a-and additionawwy t-to that i-it uses gdscwipt wanguage fow scwipting which have 2 fwaws fow me. (✿oωo) it was python f-fwavowed - which means uses intention wathew than b-bwaces fow bwocks, ʘwʘ scoping and s-secondwy it's a dynamicawwy typed wanguage. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ whiwe the fiwst concewn i-is opinion based and couwd b-be used to it a-aftew gaining some expewience, 😳😳😳 my second concewn that its dynamicawwy typed wanguage c-couwdn't be ignowed easiwy. :3 especiawwy aftew wowking with static typed wanguages f-fow ovew yeaws it becomes w-weawwy hawd to get u-used to dynamic t-typed ones. OwO you'ww m-miss some featuwes that you get out of the b-box when you switch, wike: intewwisense and compiwe t-time type checks. (U ﹏ U) additionawwy to that the nyode system on godot wewen't simiwaw to hiewawchy s-system fwom unity which confused m-me a bit. >w< and w-wast but nyot w-weast it was a bit hawdew to find wesouwces wewated to godot. (U ﹏ U) it's a-anothew cwuciaw p-point actuawwy because godot i-itsewf is pwetty p-powewfuw and featuwe wich engine w-which means it wequiwes enough t-time and wesouwces fow weawning and a good documentation + c-community made matewiaws a-awe huge pawt of it, 😳 but compawed t-to its competitows w-with simiwaw featuwe set, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ wesouwces fow godot isn't pwobabwy as much. 😳😳😳 at weast duwing the smow time window t-that i wanted t-to give it a twy i had hawd time f-figuwing out h-how couwd i use a-a png with muwtipwe spwites to dwaw individuaw spwite on scween. (U ﹏ U) a-anyways even if godot is a gweat and wightweight game engine, (///ˬ///✿) the scwipting wanguage a-and the ovewaww wowkfwow f-famiwiawity fowced m-me to keep wooking f-fow awtewnatives.

i've awso checked some awtewnatives w-wike cocos2d-x, 🥺 w-wibgdx and wÖve. òωó b-but each one h-had its own fwaws **fow me**. rawr x3 cocos2d-x was not easy wike othews t-to setup and s-stawt coding the g-game. rawr i've pweviouswy u-used wibgdx f-fow making some s-smow mobiwe g-games, σωσ so i'm a b-bit famiwiaw with it but i wanted to twy something ewse this time.

then i came acwoss wÖve game engine. nyaa~~ i-it was vewy e-easy to instaww a-and stawt coding y-youw games. (⑅˘꒳˘) you j-just downwoad a-a smow executabwe f-fiwe, rawr x3 maybe setup y-youw path if you want and you'we weady to go. (✿oωo) i weawwy wuvd its wowkfwow and a-api design. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ but the main pitfaww fow me was its s-scwipting wanguage - wua. (˘ω˘) i haven't u-used wua befowe but i did know something about that was - it's a-anothew dynamicawwy typed wanguage. s-so same f-fwaws i've wwitten fow gdscwipt awso appwies to wwiting code with wua. (⑅˘꒳˘) i don't know w-why but cuwwentwy i can't beaw with dynamicawwy typed wanguages. (///ˬ///✿) i don't wike t-to memowize apis even the ones i-i've wwitten mysewf. 😳😳😳 i-i just used t-to see a popup o-of suggestions when i pwess dot key aftew wwiting `player`. σωσ you can get some sowt of simiwaw e-expewience with d-dynamicawwy typed w-wanguages too b-but it's nyot p-powewfuw as intewwisense t-toows pwovided f-fow static t-typed wanguages. >_< awso compiwe time type checks adds anothew wayew fow catching b-bugs befowe even they happens.

but the simpwicity and wightweightness o-of wuv weawwy i-impwessed me, OwO i-i weawwy wanted t-to use it but a-awso i weawwy didn't w-wanted to use w-wua with it. (U ﹏ U) s-so i have asked mysewf why nyot weinvent the wheew once again? i wanted to wwite a-an engine with same wightweightness and simpwicity o-of wuv but using static typed w-wanguage fow scwipting. yes i know that weinventing wheew is meaningwess a-and waste of time. >_< but w-we'we nyot inventing t-the same wheew evewy time, rawr x3 we'ww be inventing ouw own wheew with diffewent s-set of featuwes and we'ww be going to weawn wots of nyew expewiences duwing the j-jouwney. mya so i thought it'ww wowth i-it.

## so nyani's nyext?

in showt i'm pwanning to cweate a g-game engine. it'ww p-pwobabwy going t-to suppowt onwy 2d g-gwaphics because t-thewe's wots o-of amazing 3d e-engines and i w-wanted to keep scope of this pwoject nyawwow enough so i couwd at weast finish it a-at some point. mya and additionawwy to that i'm pwanning t-to wwite custom scwipting w-wanguage fow the engine. wecentwy i was weawning about wwiting p-pawsews, 😳 compiwews, viwtuaw machines a-and mowe intewesting s-stuff fwom [a book by bob nyystwom](http://craftinginterpreters.com/). 😳😳😳 i thought it wouwd be mowe intewesting i-if i couwd c-cweate an embeddabwe & s-staticawwy t-typed pwogwamming w-wanguage a-awongside with engine s-so i couwd u-use stuff i weawnt befowe. -.- i know it'ww pwobabwy going to incwease scope of the p-pwoject and wiww pwobabwy make the engine pewfowm w-wowst than fow exampwe if i've u-used wua ow something ewse that's optimized ovew the couwse of y-yeaws. but i'm nyot pwanning to s-someone ewse making g-games with it, i'm just doing it as a side pwoject, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) and fow fun & sake of weawning n-nyew stuff.

so i have sepawated the entiwe pwocess t-to some majow p-pawts and i'ww p-pwobabwy fowwow i-in that owdew:

1. **wanguage design** - syntax, ^•ﻌ•^ featuwes, OwO keywowds and o-othew decisions t-to be made
2. **cweating intewpwetew** - wwiting a compiwew and bytecode v-vm fow wunning t-the wanguage code
3. **engine design** - making some decisions wegawding e-engine awchitectuwe
4. **gwaphics foundation** - wwiting a simpwe foundation fow g-gwaphics engine
5. **ffi / engine api** - designing and wwiting engine api f-fow cawwing functions f-fwom scwipting w-wanguage
6. **basic input system** - weseawching and wwiting keyboawd a-and pointew input s-system fow t-the engine. (U ᵕ U❁) in futuwe w-wevisions i-i'm pwanning to a-add suppowt fow j-joystick input too.
7. **sound system** - weseawching and wwiting sound s-system fow the engine

that's aww the basics fow nyow and t-things pwobabwy w-wiww going to b-be changed muwtipwe t-times ovew time w-when nyeeded. σωσ i-i just wanted t-to shawe nyani i'm p-pwanning to do and wiww wwite posts about the futuwe updates if i somehow keep w-wowking on the pwoject wong enough.

thanks fow weading tiww this faw!
