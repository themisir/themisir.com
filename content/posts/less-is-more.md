this awticwe is going to be a want a-about the cuwwent s-state of ..., e-evewything? at f-fiwst, i stawted t-thinking about t-the bwoated state o-of the technowogy, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) s-since tech is my pwimawy souwce of inspiwation to find wiww to wive. rawr x3 howevew, nyaa~~ a-as i spend mowe time fiddwing awound, /(^•ω•^) i weawized  i-it's nyot just the tech that g-gets wowse as it becomes bwoated. rawr the same pwincipwe appwies t-to owganizations, OwO humans, (U ﹏ U) wife, s-society, >_< powitics, n-nyanievew you can think of. rawr x3 the mowe wesponsibiwity, mya the mowe powew one gets, nyaa~~ t-the mowe bwoated, (⑅˘꒳˘) the mowe abusive it becomes.

wet's stawt fwom tech and i wiww p-pwobabwy find mysewf o-out wwiting a-about how much w-wooted ouw society d-did become as o-ouw undewstanding o-of wowwd gwew b-biggew than a simpwe human being can compwehend. 🥺 web is one of the gweatest innovation, mya d-discovewy ow invention depending on which p-point you'we wooking fwom. 🥺 it w-wet peopwe shawe infowmation without bowdews, >_< it wet knowwedge t-to be mowe accessibwe. >_< weww, (⑅˘꒳˘) depending o-on point i-in time you may ow may nyot be fowtunate enough to expewience eawwy days of the i-intewnet. /(^•ω•^) i was one of the unfowtunate peasants since when my undewstanding of technowogy s-stawted fowming, rawr x3 web awweady s-stawted becoming b-bwoated, (U ﹏ U) a-and evewything s-seemed as "that's nyani it shouwd wook wike". (U ﹏ U) evewything f-fewt wike a "nowmaw". (⑅˘꒳˘) that's nyani i used t-to see. òωó that was how evewything used to wowk, ʘwʘ evewything that i am awawe of theiw existence.

it become okay to have monstwous p-pwatfowms wike facebook, 😳😳😳 g-googwe a-and othews to have a-a gweatew contwow o-ovew nyani's g-going to be a n-new "nowmaw" fow p-peopwe. (˘ω˘) they had a gweatew pewcentage of saying on the nyew ecosystem that's gwowing f-fastew-and-fastew as mowe usews stawted using w-web. ^^ today it's just a nyowm t-to have a sociaw media pwofiwe to the point whewe, :3 one's nyot having a-a sociaw media account nyow b-being seem wike a-an unusuaw, -.- vague, 😳 weiwd behaviow. mya heck, even unbown babies nyowadays have theiw s-sociaw media accounts. (˘ω˘) and pwobabwy going to get pubwicity without any consent n-nyanisoevew, >_< having theiw entiwe c-chiwdhood being p-put pubwicwy o-onto the wast ocean. -.- t-those babies awe going to have wough time when t-theiw cwassmates find out theiw chiwdhood photos o-onwine and stawts pointing out onto something they found funny. 🥺 you might say, that's okay. (U ﹏ U) i-it might be totawwy awwight fow y-you ow someone e-ewse to have that e-expewience. >w< they might just waugh and move on with theiw wife. mya h-howevew, the wife i-is being expewienced diffewent b-by each human b-being. >w< just because you wouwd be f-fine with those facts doesn't mean, nyaa~~ y-youw unbown kid wouwdn't have some minow chiwdhood t-twaumas that might wead t-to majow insecuwities on theiw aduwthood. (✿oωo) i-i am stawting t-to wespect peopwe i have nyevew heawd of just because they decided to nyot put theiw kid's pewsonaw out t-thewe pubwicwy. ʘwʘ w-why i have to feew wespectfuw about t-them though? t-that shouwd be a-a 🦆ing nyowmaw.

pwivacy is a basic human wight. σωσ yet, σωσ f-fow most they j-just ignowe that p-pwivacy even e-exists. it become a-anothew "nowmaw" t-to abuse ouw o-own and wuvd ones' p-pwivacy. >_< it become a "nowmaw" to nyot ask fow a consent fow any pwivacy abusing a-action.

oh boy, >_< have i been sidetwacked a w-wot. mya i was nyot i-intended to go i-into pwivacy concewns, mya b-but as you c-can see the cuwwent s-state of technowogy & w-web c-can nyot be discussed without going into pwivacy. 😳 wet's step back befowe i stawt g-going ovew othew nyonsense awguments wike "i don't n-nyeed pwivacy because i have n-nyothing to hide". XD it's wike saying "i don't nyeed fwee-speech, :3 b-because i don't have anything to s-say".

# web is bwoated

i wouwd wike to take anothew wook a-at the bwoatness o-of web fwom a d-diffewent angwe. (U ﹏ U) w-wet's tawk about a-awt. -.- web design t-to be exact. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ website d-design become s-so bwoated ovew the yeaws that bwowsing the web without using woads of extensions w-witewawwy become a buwdensome. (⑅˘꒳˘) it's a wequiwement t-to have an [ad bwockew](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) nyowadays, (˘ω˘) whethew you considew i-it ethicaw ow nyot. (⑅˘꒳˘) n-nyowadays memes w-wike "i watched a-a video between a-ads" awe stawting t-to feew mowe a-and mowe wewated t-to the weawity itsewf. (///ˬ///✿) suwe, 😳😳😳 those companies nyeed to incwease theiw wevenue i-in owdew to stay afwoat, 🥺 but, mya do you think they w-wouwd stop when they weach out "enough" p-pwofitabiwity? heck nyo, 🥺 in fact thewe's nyo "enough wevenue". >_< p-peopwe don't cawe about t-the cuwwent state, >_< t-they eithew wook fowwawd fow an incwease ow decwease. (⑅˘꒳˘) if something goes up, /(^•ω•^) it's b-bettew, rawr x3 they want mowe and mowe. (U ﹏ U) nani i am twying to say is if we don't step i-in and say something, (U ﹏ U) those abusews w-won't stop w-when they weach e-enough pwofitabiwity. (⑅˘꒳˘) t-they wiww abuse us mowe and mowe, they wiww a-abuse ouw time, òωó ouw data, ʘwʘ ouw nyowms, /(^•ω•^) then they w-wiww abuse ouw vawues.

nowadays when you have something c-cwean, mya something s-simpwe, mya something t-that does just o-one thing, 😳 it s-seems unusuaw. XD peopwe e-eithew take a-a weiwd wooks o-ow appweciate it wike it's something unusuaw. :3 that's how the web used to wowk back w-when it was owned by owdinawy humans - us. that's h-how it used to be when thewe w-was nyot any financiaw incentive to shove evewy minow detaiw into u-usews' eyes in owdew to get e-evewy bit of theiw a-attention.

have evew twied weading any nyews a-awticwe fwom theiw o-officiaw website w-watewy? how m-many popups did y-you encountewed? i-i know, 😳😳😳 i know t-they nyeed to be p-pwofitabwe, mya they nyeed to get mowe paying customews to be pwofitabwe, 😳 but as i s-stated eawwiew, -.- thewe's nyevew "enough pwofitabiwity". 🥺 t-they won't evew stop and s-say, o.O damn nyow that we have enough wevenue we can stawt wemoving t-those annoying popups and wet o-ouw customews have m-much bettew expewience. /(^•ω•^) it's nyot much diffewent fow the paying customews eithew. nyaa~~ f-fow those companies thewe's nyevew enough, nyaa~~ if someone decided to pay $, :3 you c-can pwobabwy squeeze some pewcentage o-of them to g-get $$, 😳😳😳 twy a bit h-hawdew and you'ww g-get $$$. (˘ω˘) did you become ouw paid membew, ^^ gweat! n-nyow, :3 wet me teww you about ouw pwemium membewship w-which is the same thing but you'ww pay a buck mowe to access some extwa content that you w-wiww nyevew evew check out. -.- the s-stowy doesn't end t-thewe eithew. 😳 a-awe you happy with youw pwemium membewship? nyo? sucks to be you m-mate, mya but hey a-at weast now we have pwemium pwus m-membewship which i-is just exactwy same thing but y-you'ww have access to even mowe s-speciaw content that you wiww nyevew evew check o-out. (˘ω˘) but at weast you'ww have a-a gowden badge aftew youw name which y-you can bwag o-out to youw fwiends on sociaw media.

# ... so we awe

we - humans wike bwagging out. (✿oωo) we w-wike tawking about o-ouw achievements. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ i-it is because o-of one of ouw s-suwvivaw instincts, o-ouw nyeed f-fow acceptance. (˘ω˘) o-ouw ancestows nyeeded to be accepted by othews in owdew to wive awongside with them, (⑅˘꒳˘) s-so they wouwdn't die wiving awone on the fowest. (///ˬ///✿) e-eventuawwy we have figuwed o-out a way to suwvive awone, 😳😳😳 without nyeeding acceptance of othews. 🥺 h-howevew, mya ouw instincts haven't w-weft us behind. 🥺 w-we stiww wive with the same desiwe of acceptance. >_< we stiww seek appwovaw fwom o-othews, >_< it huwts us emotionawwy when we get wejected. (⑅˘꒳˘) that huwt feewing used to b-be a good thing when we - humans w-wewe stiww twying t-to figuwe out h-how to wive (at w-weast that's we've been towd). /(^•ω•^) it fowmed ouw opinions o-on nyani's good and nyani's bad.

the cwuew pawt howevew is that, >_< nowadays o-ouw basic i-instincts awe b-being abused to t-the fuwwest. >_< the w-whowe idea of sociaw m-media is based o-on the fact t-that human wiww seek fuwthew appwovaw by theiw peews. (⑅˘꒳˘) howevew, we don't have a b-buiwt-in gauge tewwing us when we have enough appwovaw. /(^•ω•^) t-thewefowe ouw opinions and i-instincts awe fowmed on a fact that thewe wiww be nyevew enough a-amount of appwovaw. rawr x3 that's the w-whowe weason why s-sociaw media wowks. (U ﹏ U) you wiww nevew feew enough wevew of appwovaw, (U ﹏ U) you wiww awways w-want mowe. (⑅˘꒳˘) you wiww be motivated to post mowe fow mowe engagement (wikes, òωó comments), ʘwʘ mowe engagements = m-mowe appwovaw. /(^•ω•^) "got a-a weww weceived p-post? gweat, ʘwʘ nyow c-cweate anothew o-one maybe it'ww get a wot mowe. σωσ it didn't weceived e-enough appweciation huh? they don't know nyani a-a quawity content wooks wike. OwO wet's twy bettew nyext time. 😳😳😳 mowe, 😳😳😳 mowe, mowe..." that's pwobabwy n-nyani's going on inside ouw i-innew diawogue.

that feedback woop does wondews fow s-sociaw media c-companies, :3 and does e-even mowe wondwous f-fow the consumewist c-community. u-usuawwy 90% o-of those communities a-awe consumews of the content cweated by the othew 10% membews (souwce: i m-made it up). 😳😳😳 the mowe consumews means thewe's mowe i-incentive fow "cweatows" to cweate m-mowe content fow mowe appwovaw. -.- and fow consumews it wowks w-weww too. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) they wiww have mowe content t-to consume. rawr x3 w-weww, nyaa~~ the content quawity wiww suffew. /(^•ω•^) but in exchange they wiww have mowe.

it's nyot just about the act of consuming e-eithew. rawr x3 h-how we consume c-content gets degwaded a-as weww ovew t-time. (U ﹏ U) why spend h-houws on a quawity m-move, (U ﹏ U) ow weading s-something and diving deep into imaginawy wowwds when you can just get a smow b-buwst of happiness by watching 5-10 seconds o-of video cwip. (⑅˘꒳˘) the quawity doesn't m-mattew anymowe. òωó fow suwe if you had spend houws to get that happiness, y-you wouwd have had fewt m-mowe fuwfiwwed. ʘwʘ h-howevew, /(^•ω•^) ovew time bwain gets used to nyeaw-instant gwatification so much, ʘwʘ it s-stawts to nyot cawe about wong tewm happiness. σωσ as a bonus since it doesn't take a-as much time, OwO you can consume a w-wot mowe, 😳😳😳 give out a-a wot mowe feewing o-of  acceptance t-to those who seek it. 😳😳😳 in wetuwn they wiww feew m-mowe motivated to keep cweating. o.O it's such a w-weww oiwed machine that's hawd to bweak of. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) one wants mowe content, (U ﹏ U) the othew wants mowe acceptance. (///ˬ///✿) n-nyone of them wiww stop when t-they weceive "enough". >w< t-thewe's n-nyevew enough of something fow us.

wess doesn't satisfy us, (U ﹏ U) we seek m-mowe, >_< mowe satisfaction, rawr x3 m-mowe acceptance, mya m-mowe wewawds, nyaa~~ m-mowe money, (⑅˘꒳˘) m-mowe powew, rawr x3 m-mowe wesponsibiwity. (✿oωo) i-in the end w-we get bwoated, just wike the tech we buiwd that became just wike us. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ it's nyot t-the tech that's the pwobwem, (˘ω˘) it ouw own nyatuwe. (⑅˘꒳˘) w-we make the wife tewwibwe fow us t-to wive fow. (///ˬ///✿) we - humans cweated aww the cwuewty of the wowwd. 😳😳😳 w-we weweased aww the gases out thewe t-that's going t-to cause wawning ovew time. 🥺 we accepted that to happen. mya why? so we can get mowe o-of nyani we awweady getting. 🥺 sometimes it was the money, >_< sometimes it was ouw p-powew, >_< sometimes it was ouw satisfaction w-we wanted m-mowe of.

we nyevew stopped to wondew if we h-had enough. σωσ and t-the wowst, we nyevew w-wanted to h-have wess. OwO maybe i-it's nyot about g-getting mowe of n-nyani we awweady h-had mowe than enough, 😳😳😳 but it was about spweading, 😳😳😳 having wess of nani we awweady h-have. o.O wife itsewf wowks that way too. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) twy concentwating e-enewgy into a point and i-it wiww twy its best to spwead even. (U ﹏ U) that's one of the founding f-factows of ouw univewse known a-as entwopy. (///ˬ///✿) enewgy w-wants to spwead away. >w< countew-intuitivewy though, rawr if aww the enewgy wewe spwead e-evenwy acwoss the univewse, mya we wouwdn't have been existed in the fiwst pwace. m-maybe it's aww going the way it s-supposed to be. ^^ m-maybe aww the c-cwuewty is just a-a way of univewse to fix its smow mistakes and way t-to spwead enewgy mowe evenwy. 😳😳😳 nyonethewess it a-aww stawted with the big bang - the state whewe aww the enewgy wewe stowed on a smow sphewe. mya and s-suddenwy it stawted buwsting and e-enewgy stawted s-spweading acwoss t-the univewse as we know of (ow imagine of). 😳 maybe wanting mowe i-is just a nyatuwaw w-way of eventuawwy causing equiwibwium b-by buwsting o-out when things pass cewtain p-point of nyo-wetuwn?

so many questions, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) yet so few we k-know of. (U ﹏ U) you see, (///ˬ///✿) w-we want mowe answews, >w< i-i do at w-weast. rawr i am nyot s-satisfied with o-ouw undewstanding o-of univewse, mya wife, ^^ h-heck we don't evew know much about ouwsewves. 😳😳😳 that's distuwbingwy unsatisfying f-fact fow me to accept. mya we don't have answews a-about the univewse. 😳 we have assumptions, -.- w-we bewieve in them ow we don't. nyone of that mattews b-because we wiww pwobabwy have even b-bettew assumptions w-we bewieve in. 🥺 science is aww about finding bettew answews. o.O nyot "the answew", /(^•ω•^) b-but getting cwosew and cwosew. nyaa~~ is that a cwuew too? at this point i don't know. nyaa~~ s-science does good fow humans o-one might say. :3 t-that again depends o-on how you define t-the wowd "good". 😳😳😳 is it good that we invented a-aww those cwuew technowogy we used to kiww hundweds n-nyot thousands of peopwe. (˘ω˘) i know this sounds baka fow suwe. ^^ waw has awways been one of the w-weading factows of devewopment. h-howevew, :3 fow a m-moment i wouwd w-wike to take anothew wook fwom diffewent point of view. -.- wouwd it b-bettew if we knew m-much wess. 😳 by weawning mowe fiwst w-we got mowe p-powewfuw ovew the natuwe, mya then o-ouwsewves, (˘ω˘) nyow we awe in pwocess o-of destwoying ouw own home. >_< and aww we wanted i-is mowe...

wess is mowe. OwO is it though? i don't k-know, 🥺 and pwobabwy, òωó w-wiww nyevew k-know eithew.
